The following letter from Mr. H. B. Morse to his son, who was then at school in New York, will be found interesting :
"New York, Sept. 20th, 1857.
My dear Son,
Yours of the 19th inst. has just come to hand. I am glad you have been so well. I hope you have enjoyed your vacation. I shall write again soon.
Your affectionate Father,
H. B. Morse."
Mr. Morse's father was one of the most distinguished men of his day. He was a member of Congress for many years, and was also a prominent lawyer. His son was educated at Yale College, where he graduated with great distinction. After leaving college he went abroad, studied law, and became a successful practitioner. In politics he was a Whig, but never took active part in party affairs. He died in 1861, when his son was only twenty-two years of age.
Miss Aubrey's Letter.
Dear Mother,
I am writing this letter on board ship, as we sail for Liverpool tomorrow morning. We left New York yesterday afternoon, and arrived here last night. The weather was very fine, and we had a pleasant passage.
We were all very much pleased with our voyage. It was a long time since we had been away from home, and we were anxious to see how things were going on in England.
We landed at Liverpool yesterday evening, and spent the whole of today in looking over the town. We saw the cathedral, the university, the park, and other places of interest.
We are now on board ship, and expect to sail for Liverpool early to morrow.
With love to all,
Your affectionate daughter,
Aubrey.

Sentence: There was none of thclt light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment.
Corrected: There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment.
The room was very large, but not so large as to be oppressive. The walls were covered with pictures, some of them of great value, others of no value at all. They were hung on the wall without any regard to their size or color. In fact, they were hung in such a way that one could see nothing else than the picture itself.
There was a small table near the window, upon which stood a few books, a penknife, and a pencil. A chair was placed close by, and a little further off another chair. On the floor lay a number of newspapers, and several magazines.
A man sat at the table, writing. He had a long face, and his eyes were fixed upon the paper before him. His hair was black, and he wore a pair of spectacles. He was dressed in a dark suit of clothes, and carried a cane in his hand.
He looked up from his writing when our hero entered the room.
"Ah! Mr. Brown," said he, "I am glad to see you again."
"Thank you," replied our hero; "but I have been away for some time."
"Yes?"
"About three weeks."
"And what brought you back here?"
"Business," answered our hero.
"What business?" asked the stranger.
"Oh, nothing particular," replied our hero.
"Then why did you come back?"
"Because I wanted to see you."
"Why do you want to see me?"
"Because I like you."
"Well," said our hero, "that's a good reason."
"But why do you like me?"
"Because I think you're a nice fellow."
"That's very kind of you," replied our hero.
"You're welcome," continued the stranger. "Now tell me about yourself."
"I'm a clerk in a bank," replied our hero.
"Do you like your work?"
"Not particularly."
"Why don't you like it?"
"Because it's monotonous."
"Monotonous!" repeated our hero.
"Yes," continued the stranger, "it's monotonous. It's the same thing every day. Nothing ever happens. And then, too, you can't get anything out of it. You can't make money out of it."
"How do you mean?"
"Why, you can't make money out of it. You can't buy anything with it. You can't pay your rent with it. You can't pay your bills with it. You can't even give it to anybody else with it. You can't sell it. You can't lend it. You can't borrow it. You can't eat it. You can't drink it. You can't smoke it. You can't wear it. You can't sleep on it. You can't use it for anything except to keep it in your pocket."
"But how do you know all this?"
"Because I've been doing it for years."
"And what do you do with it?"
"I put it in my pocket."
"And where do you keep it?"
"In my pocket."
"And what do you do with it when you go home at night?"
"I take it out of my pocket and throw it into the fire."
"And what do you do with the ashes?"
"I burn 'em."
"And what do you do with the ashes?"
"I throw 'em out of the window."
"And what do you do with the window?"
"I shut it."
"And what do you do with the door?"
"I lock it."
"And what do you do with the key?"
"I lose it."
"And what do you do with the loss of the key?"
"I never find it."
"And what do you do with the loss of the key?"
"I never miss it."
"And what do you do with the money?"

The following letter from a lady to her friend, who had been
in Paris for some time, will show how much she had improved
her French during her absence.
"I have just returned from Paris, where I have been for
several months. I am very glad to find that you are well,
and hope that your health has not suffered by your long ex
tended stay abroad.
You must be surprised at my having written so little since
you left me; but I have been so busy with my studies, that
I have found no leisure to write.
I have made great progress in my French, which I think
is now quite good. I have also acquired considerable
knowledge of the history of France, and can speak of many
interesting things concerning the country.
I have seen all the principal sights of Paris, and have
been to Versailles, Fontainbleau, St. Cloud, and other places
of interest.
I have met with several Americans here, and they seem
to be very fond of America. They say that we are a very
good people, and that our institutions are superior to those
of Europe.
They tell me that the English are very jealous of us,
and that they do not like us to get on their ground.
I have heard nothing about the war, except what I have
read in the papers. The newspapers here are very dull,
and contain nothing but politics.
I have read "Waverley," and "Guy Mannering." I
think they are both very good books.
I have received a letter from Mr. B., telling me that he
has been to New York, and that he thinks that the war
will soon come to an end. He says that the English are
very anxious to make peace, as they cannot afford to lose
their colonies.
I have received another letter from him, dated May 1st,
which informs me that he has been to Philadelphia, and
that he thinks that the war will soon be over. He says
that the English are very anxious to make peace, as they
cannot afford to lose their colonies.
I have also received a letter from Mrs. A., dated April
10th, which tells me that she has been to Boston, and
that she thinks that the war will soon be over. She says
that the English are very anxious to make peace, as they
cannot afford to lose their colonies.
I have also received a letter from Mr. C., dated March
15th, which informs me that he has been to Washington,
and that he thinks that the war will soon be over. He
says that the English are very anxious to make peace,
as they cannot afford to lose their colonies.
I have also received a letter from Mr. D., dated March
18th, which informs me that he has been to Baltimore,
and that he thinks that the war will soon be over. He
says that the English are very anxious to make peace,
as they cannot afford to lose their colonies.
I have also received a letter from Mr. E., dated March
26th, which informs me that he has been to Richmond,
and that he thinks that the war will soon be over. He
says that the English are very anxious to make peace,
as they cannot afford to lose their colonies.
I have also received a letter from Mr. F., dated March
27th, which informs me that he has been to Charleston,
and that he thinks that the war will soon be over. He
says that the English are very anxious to make peace,
as they cannot afford to lose their colonies.
I have also received a letter from Mr. G., dated March
29th, which informs me that he has been to Savannah,
and that he thinks that the war will soon be over. He
says that the English are very anxious to make peace,
as they cannot afford to lose their colonies.
I have also received a letter from Mr. H., dated March
30th, which informs me that he has been to Augusta,
and that he thinks that the war will soon be over. He
says that the English are very anxious to make peace,
as they cannot afford to lose their colonies.

31st, which informs me that he has been to Charleston,
and that he thinks that the war will soon be over. He

Corrected: There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that indicated a soul conscious of a brighter realm.
The following letter was written by Mr. J. B. Houghton, who has been for many years connected with the New York Herald office, and who now resides at Washington. It will be seen that he had no idea of the real cause of his illness until after he had left the city.
"I have just received your note of the 17th inst., and I am sorry to say that you were right in your surmise as to my health. I have been suffering from a severe attack of typhoid fever ever since I returned from Europe on the 25th ult. The symptoms were very much like those of cholera, but they gradually subsided, and I thought myself quite well when I reached this place. But the disease has again attacked me, and I find myself in a most critical condition. I shall probably die before morning.
"I have been so weak all day that I could hardly write. I am obliged to lie down every few minutes, and then I can only think of death. I hope that you will come over here soon, and see how miserable I am. I am sure that you would do anything in your power to help me. I know that you are too good a man to suffer such a trial as this without coming to my relief.
"I am writing these lines in a state of great agitation. I cannot sleep, and I am afraid that I shall never get over this terrible attack. I am almost certain that I shall die before morning. I wish that I might live to see you once more. I should like to tell you what a comfort it has been to me during the past week to hear of your safe arrival in this country. I have felt so lonely and desolate, and I have often wished that I could have gone back to England and died there.
"I am going to take a dose of morphine, and then I shall try to go to sleep. I must close now, as I am afraid that I shall fall asleep while I am writing. Good-bye."
Mr. Houghton's letter was written in a handwriting which was peculiarly his own, and which was always difficult to decipher. He was a man of great energy, and of great physical strength, and yet he was subject to attacks of sickness, which seemed to come upon him suddenly, and to leave him prostrate for hours together. His last illness was one of the severest that he had ever experienced.
He was born in London, and came to America in 1846. He was employed in the New York Herald office from its organization, and remained there till the time of his death. He was a member of the New York Press Club, and was regarded as one of the best writers of the English language.
His death was sudden and unexpected. He was found dead in bed, with his head resting on his arm, and his eyes closed. He had taken a large dose of morphine, and had been suffering from a severe attack of typhoid fever.
The following letter was written by Mr. W. S. C. Morse, Esq., of Boston, and was addressed to Mr. Houghton. It was dated at Washington, Jan. 3d, and was brought to New York by the mail steamer "City of Paris," which sailed yesterday afternoon.
"DEAR MR. HOUGHTON,
"I have just received your letter of the 17th inst., and I am glad to learn that you are better. I trust that you may recover speedily, and that you may be able to join us in Boston.
"I have been anxiously expecting your return, and I have been looking forward to hearing from you. I have heard nothing from you since you left us, and I began to fear that something had happened to you. I have been thinking of you night and day, and wishing that I could have been with you.
"I am sorry to hear that you are still ill. I hope that you will soon get well. I am sure that you will do everything in your power to help me. I want you to come over here as soon as possible, and see how miserable I am. I am sure that you would do anything in your power to relieve me.
"I am sending you a copy of the Boston papers, which contain a notice of our meeting. I hope that you will read them carefully, and that you will remember me kindly.
"I am going to take a dose of morphine, and then I shall try to go to sleep. I must close now, as I am afraid that I shall fall asleep while I am writing. Good-bye."

The following letter from Mr. H. W. Bates to his friend, Mr. J. M. C., of New York, will show how much he valued her friendship :
"I have just received your kind letter of the 17th inst. I am very glad you like my new book. It has been a great pleasure to me to write it ; but I fear I shall never be able to equal its merit. The subject is one on which I feel deeply interested, and I hope I have not failed in giving it the proper weight and dignity. I am sorry to hear that you are suffering from the effects of the climate. I trust you will soon recover. I am sure you will find the society of good friends as agreeable as ever. I wish you could come over here for a few days. I should like to see you again before I leave this country. I am going to spend some time at Niagara Falls, and then go up to Canada. I shall probably return by way of Albany. I shall be delighted to meet you there. I shall also take the opportunity of calling upon Mrs. Bates. I shall be happy to see you both. I am afraid we shall not get together again this year. I shall certainly write to you next spring."
Mr. Bates had written to his friend, Mr. J. M. C., about the same time, as follows :
"DEAR MR. C.:
I have just returned from a visit to Niagara Falls. I found the place more beautiful than ever. I spent two days there, and enjoyed every moment. I saw the falls from all points of view, and was particularly struck with their grandeur and beauty. I think they are now more magnificent than ever. They were always grand, but they have become more so since the opening of the canal. I went down to the foot of the rapids, and stood on the brink of the water, looking down into the chasm below. It was a sublime spectacle. I felt as though I could look forever without being tired. I was almost overcome with awe and reverence. I was reminded of the words of the Psalmist : "When I consider thy heavens, the work of thine hands, the moon and stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man that thou art mindful of him ? And the son of man that thou takest care of him? Yet thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet."
I was also impressed with the thought that these wonders of nature were created for our use and benefit. We ought to be thankful for them, and use them wisely. I was told that the falls were once covered with ice, and that the Indians used to make canoes out of the ice. This would account for the peculiar shape of the rocks around the falls.
I was also pleased with the sight of the boats passing through the rapids. There seemed to be no danger of their capsizing. The men who steer them seem to know their business. I was told that the boats are steered by a combination of steam power and human muscle. The steam power is supplied by a boiler, which is placed in the stern of the boat. A large paddle wheel is attached to the shaft of the engine. The paddles are worked by eight men, who sit in a row behind the wheel. The men are dressed in white suits, and wear white hats. They are provided with life preservers, and are instructed to keep a sharp lookout. When the boat approaches a rock, the men pull the paddles back, and the boat stops. Then they pull the paddles forward, and the boat moves ahead. The men are very careful, and do not allow the boat to approach too near the rock.

Corrected: When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy ; but when her brother breathed to her his affectionate greeting, and forgot his sorrows, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the happy ? Who would have exchanged her face for that of the pure and spotless?
The following letter from a lady to her sister, will show how much this feeling may be felt by one who has not been brought up under its influence :
"I am writing you a few lines to let you know what I think of your dear little girl. She is very pretty, and I like her very much. Her hair is so fine and curly, and her complexion so delicate, that I can't help thinking she must be very good. I wish I could see her more often, but I don't think I shall ever get the opportunity. I hope you will write me soon, and tell me all about her. I should like to hear something about her father too."
A young man writes to his friend, after having seen him at church on Sunday morning: "I saw you yesterday at church. How do you like my new hat?"
"Oh! yes," says the other, "I saw it. But I didn't like it. What did you wear?"
"Why, nothing," replied the first. "I wore my old hat."
"And why did you not wear yours?" asked the second.
"Because I had no hat," said the first.
"But you might have worn mine," said the other.
"Yes," answered the first, "but I thought you wouldn't want to."
"Well," said the other, "you see I had none."
"That's just like you," said the first.
"What!" exclaimed the other, "doesn't he always say that you have no sense?"
"No," said the first, "he doesn't say that. He only says that you have no sense."
"Then," said the other, "I'll give you some advice. Don't talk so much nonsense. You ought to know better than to make such a foolish remark. Why don't you go home and put on your hat?"
"Why?" said the first.
"Because you've got none," said the other.
"You're right," said the first, "and I'm sorry I made that remark. I won't do it again."
"Don't you dare to," said the other.
"Why not?"
"Because you're a fool."
"Well," said the other, "if you call me a fool, I'll call you a liar."
"All right," said the first, "I'll call you both a liar."
"Now," said the other, "don't you dare to call me a liar."
"Why not?"
"Because you're a fool."
"Well," said the other, "if you call me a fool, I'll call you a liar."
"All right," said the first, "I'll call you both a liar."
"Now," said the other, "don't you dare to call me a liar."

The following letter of Mr. Bacon to Dr. Franklin, dated at Philadelphia, May 10th, 1785, will show how much the latter valued the friendship of this distinguished man.
"Philadelphia, May 10, 1785.
Dr. Franklin,
Your favor of the 29th ult., which I received yesterday, has been forwarded to me by a friend who has just returned from Europe. It contains some very interesting particulars respecting your health, and also gives you an account of the progress of the war with France. The latter part of it is particularly curious; for it informs us that the French government have sent out a fleet of twenty-four ships of the line, under the command of M. De Grasse, to attack our West India islands, and that they have taken possession of Martinique, Guadeloupe, St. Domingo, and other places on the coast of America. This intelligence is so new, that I am unable to give you any idea of its importance. But as soon as I can learn anything further about it, I shall write again to you.
In the mean time, I must beg leave to say, that though I do not know whether you ever heard of my being in England, yet I have often wished to see you, and hope that we may meet hereafter. I have always esteemed you one of the most valuable friends I have in the world, and I am sure that you would think so too, if you knew all the good offices you have done me.
I am, dear Sir,
Yours sincerely,
Thomas J. Bacon."

The following letter from Mr. Brougham to Lord John Russell, on the subject of the proposed Reform Bill, will show how much he had been influenced by the views of the Duke of Wellington :
"My dear Sir," said Mr. Brougham, "the question of Reform has become one of the most important that ever occupied the public mind. I am not aware that you have yet taken a decided part in it; but I think it right to inform you that I have done so. I have written to Lord John Russell, and told him my sentiments on this subject. He has replied, and I shall give you his letter. I do not know whether you will approve of what he says, or not; but I think it right to let you know his opinion.
"Lord John Russell's letter is as follows:
"MY DEAR SIR,
"I have received your letter of the 17th instant, and read with great interest the arguments which you have adduced in support of the principle of Reform. I agree with you entirely in the necessity of reforming our representation, and in the propriety of doing it by the ballot. But I cannot agree with you in the mode of carrying it out.

The following letter was written by a young lady who has just returned from a visit to her father's family at New York.
"I have just arrived here after a pleasant journey," says she, "and I am glad to find that you are all well. I shall be happy to see you again soon."
A few days ago, while on my way home from the city, I met with a most unexpected accident. A gentleman, whom I knew only as Mr. Smith, stopped me, and asked me if I were going to the country? I replied in the affirmative, and then inquired what time I intended leaving town. He said that he would accompany me, and we should reach our destination before night. I accepted his offer, and we started together for the country. We drove along very pleasantly until we reached the outskirts of the city, when he suddenly turned into a side street, and told me that he had changed his mind, and wished to go back to the city. I was surprised at this sudden change of purpose, and asked him why he had done so. He replied that he had received a note from his wife, informing him that she was dangerously ill, and begging him to come immediately to her assistance. This was too much for me to bear, and I exclaimed, "What! your wife sick! Why did you not tell me sooner?" He replied, "Because I thought you would come to the city, and I wanted you to take care of her." I felt deeply grieved at this unfeeling conduct, and I told him that I would return to the city without him. He replied, "No, no, stay with me, and do as I bid you." I refused to comply with his request, and we parted company. I went directly to the house where my mother resides, and informed her of the circumstance. She was greatly alarmed, and sent for Dr. Brown, who came immediately. The doctor examined Mrs. Smith, and pronounced her dangerously ill. In a short time she expired, and left behind her a husband and two children.
The following letter was written by a young man who has recently married.
"DEAR WIFE," says he, "I write to you to thank you for the kind attention which you paid to me during my illness. I am now quite recovered, and hope to see you soon. I will give you a full account of my travels, and of the places I visited. I shall also send you some of my photographs, taken during my absence. I am sorry that I cannot give you a more satisfactory answer than this, but I trust that you will forgive me, and believe that I meant every word I said. I am, dear wife, your affectionate husband."
A young lady writes to her friend, "I have just returned from a visit to my uncle, who lives in the country. I found him very much altered since I saw him last. His face is pale, and his eyes look hollow. He tells me that he has lost his wife, and that he is alone in the world. I am very sorry for him, and wish to console him. I shall try to cheer him up, and make him forget his sorrows."

Sentence: They soon arrived in town, and prepared f0r the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.
Corrected: They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.
Their arrival was hailed with delight by all who knew them, and they were received with every mark of respect. The ladies wore their best dresses, and the gentlemen were dressed in their finest attire.
The evening passed off very pleasantly, and the company were much pleased with themselves.
They returned home at night, and found that the house was full of people, who came to see the new arrivals.
The next morning, when the family awoke, they found that the whole house was filled with strangers.
They looked around, but could not discover whence these strangers came.
At length one of the servants told them that they had come from the country, and that they had heard of the great beauty of the young lady's mother, and wished to pay her a visit.
This was too good an opportunity to be lost, so the father went down stairs, and asked the stranger to accompany him into the parlor.
He then introduced his daughter to the stranger, and said, "My dear sir, this is my daughter; she has just arrived from the country."
"I am glad to meet you," replied the stranger, "and I hope you will excuse me for having made your acquaintance in such a strange manner."
"Not at all," answered the gentleman, "but we have met before, though I did not know it till now. We were both at school together, and I remember well how handsome you were."
"Thank you," replied the young lady, "and I hope you will forgive me for not remembering you."
"Never mind," rejoined the stranger, "you are quite right. I shall never forget you. I am Mr. Smith, and this is my daughter, Miss Jane Smith."
"And I am Mrs. Jones," added the lady, "and this is my daughter, Miss Mary Jones."
"Then you must be my sister," exclaimed the young lady, "for I have often heard of your beauty."
"Yes," replied the stranger, "we are sisters, and I am delighted to make your acquaintance."
After this introduction, the two families became fast friends, and the young ladies spent several pleasant days with them.
When they left, they promised to return again, and the young ladies were very sorry to part with them.
The next time they visited the city, they brought their parents along with them, and they were received with great kindness by the whole family.
From that time forward, the young ladies and their parents frequently paid visits to the Joneses, and they always found them most hospitable and kind.
In fact, they became so fond of them, that they would not think of leaving them without first asking their permission.
One day, when the young ladies were visiting the Joneses, they saw a letter lying on the table, addressed to their father.
It was from their uncle, who lived in another part of the country, and he wrote to say that he was coming to see them, and that he hoped they would receive him kindly.
The young ladies were very glad to hear this, and they immediately sent word to their father, telling him what had happened.
He was very much surprised, and asked them why they had not written to him about it.
"We thought it better," replied the young ladies, "to let you know ourselves, and not depend upon others to tell you."
"Well," said the father, "I suppose you are right. But I should like to know why you have not written to me?"
"Because," replied the young ladies, "we do not want you to come here. We have plenty of company here, and we don't need any more."
"But," said the father, "if you really wish to keep me away, I can understand that. But if you really mean to refuse me, I shall feel very hurt."
"Oh no," replied the young ladies, "we only meant to let you know that we are perfectly independent, and that we don't want you to come here. We have plenty of company here, and we don't need any more."
The father was greatly astonished at this reply, and he felt very much hurt. He had expected that his daughters would have invited him to come and see them, and he had supposed that they would have done so.
He was very angry, and he said nothing for some time. At last he spoke up, and said, "You are very unkind, my dear children. Why do you treat me like this? I have always been your father, and I ought to be treated as such."
"Don't be angry," replied the young ladies, "we didn't mean anything by what we said. We only wanted to let you know that we are perfectly independent,

There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blush was never lightened by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that indicated a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was that light footstep, which strays wherever a butterfly or colour may attract-it was sedate and thoughtful. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy ; but when her brother breathed to her his affectionate greeting, and forgot his sorrows, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the happy ? Who would have exchanged her face for that of the pure and spotless? She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her preservation should be deferred until her brother's return from the continent, when she might be his protector. The next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entrance into the busy scene. Aubrey would rather have remained a recluse in the mansion of his father, and fed upon the incense of the past.

Corrected: While ho was standing in a corner by himself, bereft of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place-he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized toowell, sounded in his ear -"Remember your oath." He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blot out his existence; but perceiving, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his attention on his first entrance into this city, he perceived also that the same personage who had spoken to him then, was now before him.
The following letter from Mr. Brougham to Mr. Gladstone, dated London, Jan. 15th, 1867, will show how much the latter's influence had been exerted in the matter of the Irish Church Bill :
Mr. Gladstone has written me again about the Irish Church Bill. I have not yet read his letter, but I shall do so as soon as possible. The question is one of great importance, and I am anxious to know what you think of it. I should like to hear your opinion on it, and whether you approve of it?
You may remember that I wrote to you on the subject of the Irish Church Bill, and expressed my opinion that it ought to pass. I said that I thought it would be better for Ireland than the present state of things, and that it would be better for England than the present state of things. But I did not say that it would be better for England than the present state of things. That is a point on which we differ.
I am glad to find that you agree with me in thinking that the bill ought to pass. It is a measure of justice to the Catholics, and of good policy to the Protestants. It is a measure of justice to the Catholics, because they have suffered more than other people under the penal laws. They have suffered more than other people, because they were treated worse than other people. They have suffered more than other people, because they were treated worse than other people. And they have suffered more than other people, because they were treated worse than other people.
It is a measure of good policy to the Protestants, because it will make them feel that their religion is respected. It will make them feel that their religion is respected, because it will give them the right to worship according to their own consciences. It will make them feel that their religion is respected, because it will give them the right to worship according to their own consciences.
But I must tell you, that I do not think that the bill will be passed. I think that it will be defeated. I think that it will be defeated, because it will be opposed by the Whigs. I think that it will be opposed by the Whigs, because they will say, "We cannot support such a measure." I think that it will be opposed by the Whigs, because they will say, "We cannot support such a measure."

The following letter from Mr. H. B. Morse, Esq., of New York, to the editor of this paper, will be found on page 107. It contains some very interesting facts relative to the early history of the telegraph.
A Letter from Mr. H. B. Morse, Esq.
New York, Jan. 25, 1860.
Sir? I have been requested by several gentlemen who were present at the meeting held yesterday evening at the Hotel Astor, to give you a copy of a letter which I received from Mr. Samuel Morse, dated at Washington, D. C., January 22d, 1860. The letter is as follows:
"Washington, Jan. 22, 1860.
Mr. Editor?I am sorry that I cannot attend your meeting to-night, but I shall send you a short account of what passed there.
It was a most interesting affair. There were about one hundred persons present, including many distinguished men. The principal speakers were Messrs. Trowbridge, Wm. F. Poole, Jas. A. Gould, John P. Hale, and myself.
The first speaker was Mr. Trowbridge, who spoke for two hours, and made a most eloquent appeal to the people to adopt the telegraph. He said that the time had arrived when we must either adopt the telegraph, or be left behind by all other nations. He showed how much more rapidly information could be transmitted over the wires than by the post; and how much more cheaply, too. He then read a long list of the advantages of the telegraph, and concluded with saying that the time had come when every man should own a telegraph instrument, and that every family should have one.
After Mr. Trowbridge's speech, Mr. Poole took the floor, and gave a very able address, showing how the telegraph would benefit commerce, and how it would enable us to communicate with our friends and relatives at a distance.
Then came my turn. I spoke for half an hour, and dwelt upon the great importance of the invention, and its effects upon the world. I said that the telegraph would unite the whole civilized world, and make us acquainted with everything that happened abroad. I said that it would enable us to know the state of the weather, and the condition of the ocean, and the progress of the war. I said that it would enable us to know the movements of the enemy, and the strength of his army. I said that it would enable us to know the price of goods, and the value of stocks. I said that it would enable us to know the news of the day, and the doings of the government. I said that it would enable us to know the prices of commodities, and the value of money. I said that it would enable us to know the condition of the country, and the health of the people. I said that it would enable us to know the number of ships sailing, and the amount of freight carried. I said that it would enable us to know the number of passengers embarking, and the destination of the vessels. I said that it would enable us to know the number of emigrants leaving the country, and the destination of the vessels. I said that it would enable us to know the number of immigrants arriving, and the destination of the vessels. I said that it would enable us to know the number of letters sent, and the number of replies received. I said that it would enable us to know the number of newspapers printed, and the circulation of the papers. I said that it would enable us to know the number of books published, and the sale of the books. I said that it would enable us to know the number of patents granted, and the inventions patented. I said that it would enable us to know the number of marriages contracted, and the number of divorces granted. I said that it would enable us to know the number of births, and the number of deaths. I said that it would enable us to know the number of churches built, and the number of funerals performed. I said that it would enable us to know the number of schools opened, and the number of pupils taught. I said that it would enable us to know the number of public meetings held, and the number of speeches delivered. I said that it would enable us to know the number of political parties formed, and the number of elections held. I said that it would enable us to know the number of religious societies organized, and the number of sermons preached. I said that it would enable us to know the

The following letter from Mr. Hume to Sir James Graham,
on the subject of the proposed loan, will show how much the
government were influenced by the views of the Bankers.
"London, March 10, 1847.
Sir, I have received your letter of this morning, and am
greatly obliged for the information you have communicated
to me respecting the state of the finances of the country.
I shall be happy to give my opinion on the subject, but I
must beg leave to observe that I do not think the present
state of the public debt is such as to justify a loan of so
large a sum as £50,000,000. The amount of the national de
bt has been steadily increasing during the last ten years;
and although the annual interest paid on it may be reduced
from £60,000,000 to £50,000,000, yet the total amount of the
debt must still increase, because the annual revenue of the
country is not sufficient to pay the interest without adding
an additional sum to the principal. It is true that the
public debt has been increased by the war with France, and
by the expenses of the administration of the government;
but these causes of increase are temporary, and will soon
cease. The war with France has been carried on at great
expense, and the expense of the administration of the gov
ernment has also been very considerable. But the war
with France is now over, and the administration of the go
vernment is about to cease. The war with Spain is not
yet ended, and the cost of its prosecution cannot be estimated
at less than £10,000,000 per annum. The war with Portugal
has been carried on at a moderate expense, and the cost of
its prosecution can hardly exceed £5,000,000 per annum.
These are the principal causes of increase in the public de
bt. There are other causes, however, which operate in the
same direction, and which are equally permanent. The
annual expenditure of the government is nearly equal to the
annual income of the nation. The annual income of the na
tion is derived from the produce of land and labour. The
annual expenditure of the government is derived from the
produce of land and labour. The annual produce of land
and labour is constantly diminishing. The annual produce
of land and labour is constantly diminishing. The annual
income of the nation is therefore continually decreasing.
This is the cause why the annual expenditure of the gover
nment is continually increasing. The annual income of
the nation is therefore continually decreasing. This is the
cause why the public debt is continually increasing. The
annual expenditure of the government is therefore contin
ually increasing. The annual income of the nation is

The following letter from Mr. Brougham to Sir James Mackintosh, on the subject of the proposed Reform Bill, will show how much the latter had been influenced by the former's arguments.
Mr. Brougham's Letter to Sir Jas. Mackintosh.
Sir, I have received your letter of the 18th instant, containing a copy of the speech which you delivered yesterday in the House of Commons, on the Reform Bill.
I am sorry to say, sir, that I do not think you have done justice to my argument. The question before us is one of great importance, and ought to be treated with all the seriousness and attention which its magnitude demands.
It is true, that the present state of our constitution is such as to render it difficult to introduce any radical alterations in it. But this does not prevent us from endeavouring to improve it, and to make it more just and equal.
If we look back to the origin of our constitution, we shall find that it was formed under circumstances very different from those in which it now exists. At that time, the country was divided into two distinct kingdoms, each having its own parliament, and its own laws.
In the course of time, however, these two kingdoms were united, and the whole country became one commonwealth. This union was effected by the act of union, passed in 1707, and confirmed by the treaty of Union, concluded between England and Scotland in 1706.
This union gave rise to a new constitution, which was framed by the Parliament of Great Britain, and which has since then continued to exist.
But this constitution was not originally intended to be permanent. It was designed merely to unite the two countries, and to establish a common government over them.
When the union took place, the people of both countries were not consulted. They were left to their own discretion, and they chose to remain separate.
From that day to this, the constitution of Great Britain has remained unaltered. It has never been altered by any act of Parliament, except so far as it may have been modified by the acts of the Scottish Parliaments.
And yet, sir, this constitution has been found sufficient for the purposes of the country. It has been able to maintain peace and order among the people, and to secure to them the blessings of liberty and property.
Now, sir, what is the reason why this constitution should not be amended? Why should it not be improved? Why should it not be made more perfect?
There can be no doubt but that it would be better than it is. There can be no doubt but that it would be more just, more equal, more free, and more happy.
Why, sir, because it is the best constitution that ever existed in the world. Why, sir, because it is the only constitution that ever existed in the world.
Why, sir, because it is the most perfect constitution that ever existed in the world. Why, sir, because it is the most perfect constitution that ever existed in the world.
Why, sir, because it is the most perfect constitution that ever existed in the world. Why, sir, because it is the most perfect constitution that ever existed in the world.

TlE SENTENCE IS NOW CORRECTED BY THE FOLLOWING NOTES.
The scene took place on a Sunday evening, when the streets were crowded with people going to church. The house where the family lived was situated near the corner of Broadway and Chatham street. It was a large brick building, with a lofty tower, which rose above the roof of the adjoining houses. In front of this building stood a large iron gate, surmounted by a bell, which was rung every Sunday morning, as soon as the service was over, to summon the congregation to attend the sermon.
At half-past six o'clock, Mr. Bellingham, the father of the family, came out of the house, and went up to the top of the tower, to ring the bell. As he was about to do so, he saw a man standing close to the gate, and, looking more closely, perceived that it was one of the servants of the family. He immediately called out to him, "What do you want here?"
"I am a servant," replied the man, "and I have come to see my master."
Mr. Bellingham looked at him attentively, and then said, "You must go away from here."
"But what can I do? My master has sent me to tell you that you must leave the premises."
"Then you must go," replied Mr. Bellingham, "for I will not allow you to remain here."
The man bowed, and left the spot.
A few minutes afterward, Mr. Bellingham returned to the house, accompanied by his wife and daughter. They entered the parlor, and sat down to tea. At the same time, the servant who had been sent away, knocked at the door, and asked permission to enter.
"Come in," replied Mr. Bellingham, "but remember that you must leave the premises before night."
The servant bowed, and retired.
In a short time afterwards, the servant who had been sent away, returned, and said, "My master wishes to speak with you."
"Who is your master?" inquired Mr. Bellingham.
"His name is Mr. Bellingham," replied the servant.
"And what does he wish to say to you?"
"He wishes to know whether you have received his letter."
"No," answered Mr. Bellingham, "I have not received his letter."
"Then he wishes to know why you have not received it."
"Because I have not seen it yet," replied Mr. Bellingham.
"Well, then, he wishes to know how long you have been expecting it."
"About two hours ago," replied Mr. Bellingham.
"Then he wishes to know why you have not written to him since then."
"Because I have not had time," replied Mr. Bellingham.
"Well, then, he wishes to know what you intend doing now."
"I shall write to him again," replied Mr. Bellingham.
"Very well," rejoined the servant, "he wishes to know when you will write to him again."
"I don't know," replied Mr. Bellingham.
"Why don't you know?" inquired the servant.
"Because I haven't thought of writing to him again," replied Mr. Bellingham.
"Well, then, he wishes to know what you mean by saying that you haven't thought of writing to him again."
"I mean that I haven't thought of writing to him again because I haven't received his letter."

Their first impulse was to run away from the spot, but they were too late; the train had started, and the engine was whistling along at a rapid rate. They could not escape.
They stood still for a moment, looking around them with astonishment. The ground was covered with snow, and the trees were all bare. It seemed as though winter had come suddenly on them, and left them without shelter.
"What shall we do?" said Mr. Brown. "We must go back."
"No," replied Mr. Smith, "we cannot go back. We have no money, and we can't get any. We must stay here till help comes."
Mr. Brown looked at him for a moment, and then said, "I think I know what to do. I will write to my friend, Mr. Jones, who lives near here, and ask him to send us some money."
He took out his pocket-book, and wrote a letter, which he addressed to Mr. Jones, and put it into the post-office box. He then went up to the window, and saw the train moving rapidly away.
"Well," said he, "if we don't get any help soon, we shall have to die here."
But he did not say another word, for he knew that he would never see his friends again.
THEIR DEATH.
When the train reached the station, the passengers got off, and walked slowly homeward. They were all very sad and sorrowful, and talked about their misfortune, and how they should ever be able to pay their debts.
At last they came to a little cottage, where lived a poor widow, with two children. She was sitting alone before the fire, when she heard the sound of footsteps approaching. She opened the door, and saw the travellers coming towards her.
"Good evening," said one of them.
"Good evening," answered the woman.
"Can you give us any assistance?" asked the other.
"Yes," replied the woman, "but I am afraid we can't do anything for you. We have nothing to give you."
"Oh, thank you kindly," said the traveller. "We are sorry to trouble you, but we are in great distress. We have lost our money, and we have no means of getting any more. Can you tell us where we can get some?"
"I don't know," replied the woman. "I am sure I couldn't help you if I did."
"Thank you very much," said the traveller. "We are obliged to you for your kindness. Good night."
And with these words they passed on, leaving the poor woman standing alone before the fire.
She sat down beside the fire, and began to cry bitterly. Her husband had died many years ago, and she had only one child, a boy of ten years old. She had always been very poor, and had never been able to keep herself and her son together.
Now she was reduced to beggary, and she had no hope of ever being able to support herself and her child again.
As she sat thus, she heard a knock at the door. She opened it, and saw a gentleman, dressed in black, who handed her a letter.
"Is this from Mr. Jones?" she asked.
"Yes," replied the gentleman. "It is from him."
She read the letter, and found that it contained a large sum of money, which he had sent her to assist her in her distress.
She thanked him heartily, and then closed the door, and went back to her place by the fire.
In a few minutes the gentleman returned, and told her that he had brought her a second letter, which he hoped might also prove useful to her.
She opened the envelope, and found that it contained a check for five hundred pounds.
"God bless you!" exclaimed the lady. "You have done me a great service. I shall never forget it."
"Not I," replied the gentleman. "I shall always remember it. And now good night."
With these words he departed, leaving the poor woman almost overcome with joy.
She went to bed that night, feeling thankful to God for having sent such a kind friend to her in her hour of need.
A FEW DAYS LATER.
One morning, when the sun shone brightly, and the birds sang merrily among the branches of the trees, the poor widow rose early, and went out to look after her garden.
She had planted some flowers there, and they were beginning to bloom beautifully. As she was walking along, she met a man, who stopped

The following letter was written by Mr. H. W. Bates, of New York, to the editor of the "New York Tribune," on the subject of the recent murder at Albany, N. Y., by a negro named John Brown.
Mr. Bates says :
"I have just received your paper of yesterday, containing the account of the murder of Mr. Brown, by a negro named John Brown, at Albany, N. Y. I am sorry to say that I do not think you have done justice to the facts of the case. The whole transaction has been misrepresented, and the motives of the parties misunderstood.
John Brown was a man of good education, and possessed of considerable property. He was a member of the Methodist church, and was regarded as one of the most respectable citizens of the city. He was married, and left two children.
He was a man of great energy, and possessed of a strong will. He was a slaveholder, but did not consider himself so. He was a man of high moral character, and was esteemed by all who knew him.
His wife was a woman of superior intelligence, and possessed of much tact and ability. She was also a slaveholder, but did not consider herself so. She was a woman of great moral character, and was esteemed by all who knew her.
The motive which induced John Brown to commit the crime for which he was now being punished, was the desire to free his wife from slavery. This motive was not the result of any sudden impulse, but had been long cherished in his mind. It was the result of a careful consideration of the laws of the State, and of the Constitution of the United States.
It was the result of a study of the history of our country, and of the principles of liberty and equality which it professes to uphold.
It was the result of a deep conviction that the institution of slavery is contrary to the spirit of the Declaration of Independence, and to the principles of Christianity.
It was the result of a deep conviction that the slaves of this country ought to be free.
It was the result of a deep conviction that the Constitution of the United States ought to be interpreted according to these principles.
It was the result of a deep conviction that the laws of the State ought to be interpreted according to these principles.

The following letter was written by Mr. Brougham to Lord John Russell, on the subject of the proposed Reform Bill.
Lord John Russell,
Sir, I have received your letter of the 18th instant, containing the resolutions adopted at the meeting of the Whig Clubs held yesterday. The first resolution, which you say has been adopted, is that "the present Parliament ought not to sit beyond the 29th of March next." This resolution, as far as I can see, is perfectly clear and unequivocal. It does not say that the present Parliament shall not sit beyond the 29th of March, but that it ought not to sit beyond that day.
I am sorry to find that this resolution is so misunderstood. I do not think that the meaning of it is understood by the majority of those who voted for it. They seem to suppose that it means that the present Parliament shall not sit beyond the 29th of March, because they will not sit beyond that day. But this is not what the resolution says. It says that the present Parliament ought not to sit beyond the 29th of March. Now, if the present Parliament ought not to sit beyond the 29th of March, then the present Parliament cannot sit beyond that day. And if the present Parliament cannot sit beyond the 29th of March, then the present Parliament must necessarily dissolve before the 29th of March.
This is the plain import of the resolution. It is not intended to prevent the present Parliament sitting beyond the 29th of March, but to prevent it from sitting beyond that day.
It is true that the second resolution, which you say has also been adopted, is couched in language which may be misunderstood. It says that "no person shall be elected to serve in either House of Parliament after the 30th of June next," &c. But this is only a qualification of the right of election. It does not say that no person shall be elected to serve in either House of Parliament after the 30th of June. It merely qualifies the right of election.
If the intention of the resolution is to qualify the right of election, why did you not qualify it more clearly? Why did you not say that no person shall be elected to serve in either House of Parliament after the 30th of June? Why did you not say that no person shall be elected to serve in either House of Parliament after the 30th of July? Why did you not say that no person shall be elected to serve in either House of Parliament after the 30th of August? Why did you not say that no person shall be elected to serve in either House of Parliament after the 30th of September? Why did you not say that no person shall be elected to serve in either House of Parliament after the 30th of October? Why did you not say that no person shall be elected to serve in either House of Parliament after the 30th of November? Why did you not say that no person shall be elected to serve in either House of Parliament after the 30th of December? Why did you not say that no person shall be elected to serve in either House of Parliament after the 30th of January? Why did you not say that no person shall be elected to serve in either House of Parliament after the 30th of February? Why did you not say that no person shall be elected to serve in either House of Parliament after the 30th of March? Why did you not say that no person shall be elected to serve in either House of Parliament after the 30th of April? Why did you not say that no person shall be elected to serve in either House of Parliament after the 30th of May? Why did you not say that no person shall be elected to serve in either House of Parliament after the 30th of June?

The following letter from a lady of high rank, written at the time of the fire, will show how much the sufferers were indebted to the humanity of strangers.
"I have just received your kind letter," said she, "and I am so glad that you have been able to write me a few lines. It has been a great comfort to me to know that my poor friends are not forgotten by those who love them. The kindness which you have shown towards them, and the interest you take in their welfare, will be remembered by them as long as they live."
A gentleman, who was present on the night of the fire, says, "It was a scene of horror beyond description. The flames seemed to leap from the roof like living things, and the whole building was enveloped in smoke. The screams of women and children, mingled with the groans of the dying, filled the air. In some parts of the house the walls were literally melted away, and the people were seen struggling in the midst of the flames. The noise was terrific, and the confusion indescribable. At last the flames burst forth, and the whole building was consumed. The dead lay scattered over the ground, and the wounded were carried out in carts. The sight was too horrible to be described."
Another account of the fire is given by a gentleman who witnessed it from a distance. He says, "I saw the flames burst forth from the top of the building, and then I knew that all was lost. The whole street was covered with smoke, and the houses around were burning fiercely. The people were running about in every direction, screaming and calling for help. Some were trying to save their own property, but most of them were endeavoring to rescue their neighbors. There was such a crowd of people round the spot where the fire broke out, that it was impossible to get nearer than half a mile. The heat was intense, and the smoke was so dense that we could hardly see our hands before us. We had to keep moving forward, lest we should be suffocated. When we got within a quarter of a mile of the place, we found that the fire had spread to several other buildings, and that the whole street was in flames. The people were running wildly about, and many of them were badly hurt. They were crying for water, and begging for assistance. A number of them were lying on the pavement, and were being carried off in carts. The fire continued to rage furiously for some hours afterward, and the whole neighborhood was in a state of the greatest excitement. The police were unable to control the mob, and the streets were filled with people, who were shouting and gesticulating in the most violent manner. The firemen were doing their best to extinguish the flames, but they were hampered by the crowds of people, who would not allow them to approach close enough to do anything effective. In the end, the fire was put out by the arrival of a steam engine, which arrived just as the flames were beginning to die down. The damage done by the fire was immense. Several hundred houses were destroyed, and a large number of shops and warehouses were burnt down. The loss of life was very considerable, and the injured were numerous. The fire was caused by a spark falling from a chimney into a pile of straw, which was being used for fuel. The wind blew the flame along the building, and soon the whole thing was in a blaze. The firemen were unable to prevent the spread of the flames, and they were obliged to let them run their course. The cause of the accident was never discovered, and it is believed that it was due to carelessness rather than design. The fire was a terrible disaster, and it will be felt for years to come. It will be a long time before the people of London can forget the horrors of that dreadful night."
The following is a list of the principal buildings burned down during the fire :
- 1. The Royal Exchange.
- 2. The Bank of England.
- 3. The Stock Exchange.
- 4. The Mansion House.
- 5. The City Hall.
- 6. The Guildhall.
- 7. The Old Bailey.

Corrected: At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roomed from street to street, anxious to flee that image which haunted him.
The following letter was written by a young lady who has been very much interested in the subject of this chapter :
"I have just finished reading your interesting book on the subject of ghosts, and I must say that I am surprised at the number of people who believe in them. It seems to me that they ought to be looked upon as mere superstitions, and not taken seriously. The only way to prove their existence would be to see them with our own eyes ; but we never can do so, for they are invisible. We may hear them talking, but we cannot see them. They are like the phantoms of the Arabian Nights, which were supposed to be real persons, but could not be seen.
"It is said that some people have seen spirits, but these are generally believed to be hallucinations. There are many cases on record where people have seen things which they knew were not there. For instance, a man saw a woman's handkerchief floating over her head; another saw a table move across the floor; others have seen objects moving about without being touched. These are all hallucinations, and are easily explained.
"But what about those who have actually seen ghosts ? Are they really real? I think not. Ghosts are nothing more than the imagination of the mind. When we are frightened, we imagine that we see something which is not there. Our minds are so excited that we see things which are not visible. This is the reason why we sometimes see things when we are alone.
"There are many stories told of ghosts, but most of them are false. Some people have pretended to see ghosts, and have even published books about them. But these are all lies. Ghosts are nothing more than the imagination of the mind.
"If you want to know anything about ghosts, read my book. It will give you all the facts about them."
A Ghost Story.
By Mrs. H. B. Stoddard.
Mrs. Stoddard had lived in a large brick mansion near Boston for several years. She was a widow, and had two children, both grown up. Her husband had died suddenly, leaving her with a large fortune. She was a wealthy woman, and she spent her time in entertaining her friends. She had a fine library, and a splendid collection of pictures. She was fond of music, and often gave concerts in her drawing-room.
One evening, after dinner, she went into her library to read a novel. As she sat down, she heard a noise behind her. She turned round, and saw a tall figure standing before her. It was a gentleman, dressed in black, with a white cravat. He wore a long beard, and his face was pale and haggard. His eyes were fixed upon hers, and he seemed to be looking intently at her.
Mrs. Stoddard was startled, and she felt a cold shudder run through her body. She tried to speak, but she could not utter a word. The stranger continued to gaze at her, and then he slowly walked away.
Mrs. Stoddard was terrified, and she ran out of the room. She called her maid, and asked her to go and look for her husband. The maid searched every corner of the house, but she could find no trace of him.
When night came, Mrs. Stoddard retired to bed. She lay awake for hours, thinking of her strange visitor. At length she fell asleep, and dreamed that she was walking along a dark road. Suddenly, she saw a light shining in front of her. She approached it, and found herself in a large hall. In the centre of the hall stood a table, covered with a white cloth. On one side of the table was a chair, and on the other side was a door.
Mrs. Stoddard approached the table, and looked around her. Then she noticed that the chair was empty. She stepped forward, and tried to open the door. But it was locked. She tried again, and again, but it was impossible.
Suddenly, she heard a voice saying, "Open the door!"
She opened the door, and saw a tall figure standing before her. It was the same man who had appeared to her in the library. He was dressed in black, with a white cravat. His face was pale and haggard, and his eyes were fixed upon hers.
Mrs. Stoddard was terrified, and she fled from the room. She ran downstairs, and out of the house. She met her maid, and told her what had happened.
"What did he say?" asked

The following letter from a gentleman who has been abroad for some time, will show how much better off we are than our neighbors on this subject of public bathing.
From London, Oct. 10th, 1857.
I have just returned from Paris, where I was at the Baths during the last fortnight. The French Baths are very superior to ours. They are situated in the Rue de la Paix, near the Opera, and consist of two large buildings, one for men, the other for women. In both, the water is kept at a temperature of 86 deg., which is sufficient to render them perfectly wholesome. The bathers enter by paying a small fee, and then proceed into the warm rooms, where they remain about half an hour, when they go out again into the cold room, where they remain until the heat becomes too great. After that, they return to the warm rooms, and so on alternately till they have bathed three times. This is repeated every day, except Sundays, when the baths are open all day. The number of bathers is immense; but the place is so well ventilated, that the air is always pure and fresh. There are no bad smells, no dirt, no filthy rags, no disorderly conduct, nothing to disgust you with. The bathers are generally dressed in white linen, and wear caps, which prevent their hair from getting wet. The baths are kept clean by a few attendants, who sweep the floors, and keep everything in order. The bathers are divided into several classes, according to their age, sex, and condition. The young ladies, who are not yet married, are allowed to bathe alone, without being seen by the men. The baths are open to all persons, rich and poor alike, and are conducted on the most liberal principles. The admission fee is only 2 sous per person, and the baths are free to those who cannot pay. The baths are managed by a committee of gentlemen, who receive the money, and distribute it among the attendants. The whole establishment is under the direction of M. Lefevre, a man of great ability and experience. He is assisted by a secretary, who keeps the accounts, and a physician, who attends to the sick. The baths are open from eight o'clock in the morning, till ten at night. On Saturdays, they close at four o'clock. The baths are crowded every day, and especially on Sunday afternoons. The attendance is estimated at 30,000 persons. The baths are patronized by all classes of society, and are frequented by the nobility and gentry. The French Baths are the best in Europe, and far surpass anything that can be found in England.

The following letter from Mr. B. W. Houghton, of New York, to his friend, Mr. J. M. C., of this city, will show how much interest was taken in the progress of the expedition.
Mr. Houghton's Letter.
New York, Jan. 10, 1859.
Dear Sir,
I have just received your letter of Dec. 27th, and I am glad to find that you are still well. The news of the war has been very bad here for some time past, and we have had a great deal of excitement about it. We were all anxiously looking forward to the arrival of the steamer "Maryland," which was expected every day, and which would have brought us the news of the battle of Fort Sumter. But she did not arrive till the 3d inst., and then only after a delay of three days. She arrived on Sunday night, and left again on Monday morning. Her captain told me that she had been detained by contrary winds, and that she could not get out of port until Tuesday afternoon. This was too late to bring us the news of the battle.
We have heard nothing since her departure. It seems as though the war had come to an end. There is no news of it anywhere. The papers say nothing about it. The people seem to think that it is all over. They do not know what to make of it. Some say that the South will never give up the contest, and others say that they will.
It is said that the President has sent a message to Congress asking them to declare the Union dissolved, and to call a convention to consider the question of secession.
This is the first thing that has been done by the Government since the commencement of the war.
If the South does not yield, the war must go on. If the North yields, the war will soon be ended.
There is a great deal of talk about the tariff. The South says that it ought to be reduced, and the North says that it should remain as it now is.
The President has appointed a commission to examine into the subject.
The South says that the tariff ought to be reduced, because it puts the North at a disadvantage. The North says that it ought to remain as it now is, because it protects American manufactures against foreign competition.

The following letter was written by Mr. H. W. Beecher, of New York, to his friend, Mr. J. B. Prentiss, of that city :
"I have just received your kind letter, dated at Washington, D. C., on the 17th inst. I am sorry you did not get my last letter before leaving home. It would have been very interesting to me to know how you had passed the winter. I hope you have enjoyed it as much as possible. I am glad to hear that you are well. I suppose you will be back here again next spring ? How do you like Washington? Is it a good place to live in? Do you think you could make a living there? What do you think of the country around? Are you going to go to Europe this summer? Have you seen any of our friends lately? I hope you are all well. Give my love to Mrs. Beecher and the children. Write often.
Yours truly,
HENRY WARD BEECHER."
Mr. Beecher's reply to this letter was as follows:
"DEAR MR. BEECHER,
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 20, 1856.
MY DEAR FRIEND,
Your letter has come safe to hand, and I thank you for it. I shall be happy to answer it when I return to New York. I am glad to hear that you are well, and that you enjoy yourself. I am sorry you did not receive my last letter before leaving home. I should have answered it sooner, but I was detained by business. I am glad to hear that you are well. I hope you will be able to make a living in Washington. I don't think you can, unless you take up some profession which requires great skill. But I am sure you will find plenty of employment among the lawyers, doctors, merchants, &c. There are many other professions besides these, however, which require more general knowledge. I wish you could see our friends. I hope you will write to them frequently. I am glad to hear that you are well. I hope you will be able to spend the summer with us. I am afraid we shall not see you till next year. I am glad to hear that you are enjoying yourself. I hope you will continue so. I am sorry you did not see any of our friends. I hope you will write to them often. I am glad to hear that you are well. I hope you will be able to make a living in Washington.

The following letter from Mr. B. to his friend, Mr. J.,
was published in the New York Herald of May 10th, 1857 :
"I have just received your letter of the 29th ult., and I am
sorry to say that you are right. The people of this country
are not so much interested in the question as they ought to be;
and the reason why they are not so much interested is because
they do not understand it. They think that the question is
between England and France, and that we are only fighting
for a few acres of land on the other side of the Atlantic.
They do not see that the question is between two great nations,
England and France, and that we are fighting for the supremacy
of the world.
It is true that the English government has been very
generous with us, but still we must remember that she has
been obliged to be so by the circumstances of our situation.
She has had to protect her own commerce against the French,
and she has done it at the expense of her own trade. She
has had to maintain a large army in America, and she has
done it at the expense of her own resources. She has had to
maintain a navy which is superior to ours, and she has done
it at the expense of her own treasury. She has had to pay
the expenses of the war out of her own pocket, and she has
done it at the expense of her own credit.
But all these things are nothing compared with what
she has had to suffer herself. She has had to sustain the
burden of a war which was forced upon her by the French,
and which she could not avoid. She has had to bear the
burden of a war which was forced upon her by the French,
and which she could not prevent. She has had to endure
the humiliation of seeing her flag hoisted over the fortresses
which she had built up in the West Indies, and which were
now occupied by the French. She has had to witness the
destruction of her naval power, and the loss of her colonies.
She has had to feel the sting of defeat, and the bitterness
of defeat. She has had to know that she has lost the war,
and that she will never recover it.
And yet, after all this, she has had to bear the burden
of a war which was forced upon her by the French, and which
she could not prevent. She has had to bear the burden
of a war which was forced upon her by the French, and which
she could not prevent. She has had to bear the burden

The following letter from Mr. Brougham to Sir Robert Peel was published in the Morning Chronicle on Saturday last :
Mr. Brougham's Letter to Sir Robert Peel.
Sir Robert Peel,
I have received your letter of yesterday, and I am sorry to say that I cannot agree with you. The question now before us is not whether we shall be able to carry out our intentions, but how far we can do so without exciting the jealousy of the House of Commons.
You will recollect that when the Queen sent for me to her private apartments at Windsor Castle, she said to me, "I wish you would tell the House of Commons that you have been consulted." This was the first intimation which she gave me of her intention of carrying out the measure of disfranchising Ireland.
When I came down to London, I found that the House of Commons had been informed of this intention, and that the Government had been obliged to give way.
Now, Sir Robert, I think that the House of Commons ought to know what is going on; and I think that the House of Commons ought to know that the Queen has been consulted upon the subject.
If the House of Commons knew nothing about it, it might be thought that the Queen had been consulting herself alone; and if the House of Commons knew everything, it might be thought that the Queen had been consulting nobody.
But the House of Commons must know something. It may be that the Queen has been consulting herself alone; but it may also be that the Queen has been consulting some one else besides herself.
It is very important that the House of Commons should know what is going on. And therefore, Sir Robert, I think that the House of Commons ought to know that the Queen has been consulted.
I am sure that the House of Commons will not object to my saying that the Queen has been consulted.
Yours faithfully,
Lord Brougham.

Corrected: But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudders so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, the society which offected him so strongly.
Their father had been dead some years, but they still retained their mother's house, where she lived with them, and where they all met every evening after dinner. The family consisted of four brothers and two sisters; the eldest brother was twenty-five, the second twenty-three, the third twenty-two, and the youngest only nineteen. They were all young men, excepting the oldest, who was about thirty.
They were all very handsome, and well educated. Their father had been a merchant, and had left them a considerable fortune. He had died suddenly, leaving them all rich, and without children. His widow had married again, and had brought up her new husband's children as her own. She had also taken care to educate her own sons, and had made them all very clever.
She had not, however, been able to prevent the eldest son from becoming a gambler. This young man had been ruined by gambling, and had now become a bankrupt. He had been sent to prison, and had been there several months.
His wife had been very anxious to see him, and had often written to him, but he had never answered her letters. At length, one day, she received a letter from him, informing her that he was going to be released on the following morning.
He had been confined in a cell, and had been allowed no visitors. He had therefore determined to write to his wife, and to ask her to come and see him before he went out.
This letter was delivered to his wife by a messenger, who had been sent to fetch her. It was read over to her, and then handed back to the messenger, who took it away with him.
The next day, the messenger returned, and told her that her husband had refused to see her. "I am sorry," said he, "but I cannot help it."
"What can have induced him to refuse?" asked the lady.
"I do not know," replied the messenger. "It may be that he has changed his mind since yesterday."
"But why should he have changed his mind? What could induce him to do such a thing?"
"I don't know," replied the messenger. "Perhaps he has been frightened by something."
"By what?" inquired the lady.
"By nothing," replied the messenger. "He has simply refused to see you."
"And why did he refuse?"
"Because he does not like your company," replied the messenger.
"Then he must be mad!" exclaimed the lady.
"No, madam," replied the messenger, "he is not mad. He is only a miserable wretch, who would rather die than see you."
"Oh! how cruel!" cried the lady. "How can you treat him thus?"
"Why, because he is a gambler," replied the messenger. "Gamblers are always treated badly by their wives."
"But this is too bad!" exclaimed the lady. "You ought to tell him that I shall go to see him."
"I will do so," replied the messenger. "But remember, madam, that you must not let him see you."
"But why?"
"Because he is a gambler," replied the messenger. "If you let him see you, he will play you a trick."
"But what can he do to me?"
"Nothing," replied the messenger. "Only keep yourself quiet, and don't say anything to him."
The lady promised to obey these instructions, and went home.
When she arrived, she found her husband waiting for her.
"Well, my dear?" said he.
"Well, my dear?" replied the lady.
"Have you got your letter from your husband?"
"Yes, here it is."
"Read it," said he.
"Yes, I will read it," replied the lady.
"Now, my dear," continued he, "you must understand that I am going to be released to-morrow. I have been imprisoned for six weeks, and I have been very unhappy during that time. I have lost everything, and I have been ruined by gambling. Now, my dear, I want you to forgive me, and to forget all that has passed between us. I have done wrong, and I deserve to be punished. But I hope that you will forgive me, and that we may soon be together again."
"My dear," replied the lady,

The following letter from Mr. Hobart to Mr. Bacon, dated at Paris, May 10th, 1857, will show how much he valued this confidence of his father's?
"I have just received your kind letter of the 29th ult., and I am very sorry to hear that you are not well. I hope you will soon be better. I shall always feel grateful for all the kindnesses you have done me during my stay here. I should like to see you some day, but I do not know when I can come back. I am now writing a book on the French Revolution, and I think it will be published next year. It has cost me a great deal of trouble, and I am afraid it will not be popular with the English people. But I must say that I have found the French people very friendly to me, and I have made many friends among them. I have also met with several Englishmen who have shown me every attention.

The following letter was written by Mr. Bacon to Dr. Cary, on the subject of the treatment of the insane.
Letter from Mr. Bacon to Dr. Cary.
New York, July 10, 1856.
Dr. Cary,
I have received your letter of the 29th ultimo, and I am much obliged to you for the information which you have communicated to me respecting the treatment of the insane. It has been my practice for many years to treat them with kindness and humanity; but I do not think that this will be sufficient to cure them. The reason why I believe this is because the disease itself is curable only when it is treated with proper remedies.
It is true that some persons recover after being confined for years in madhouses; but these cases are exceptional, and are generally caused by the peculiar constitution of the patient. In most instances, however, the disease continues until death ensues.
In treating the insane, therefore, we must first ascertain whether their condition is due to organic causes, or to constitutional derangements. If the latter, then we must apply remedies which shall remove the cause of the disease. This can only be done by giving them a proper diet, and by administering medicines calculated to restore the functions of the brain.
If the former, then we must confine them in a room where they cannot escape, and where they may be watched at all times. We must also give them such food as will keep them in good health, and prevent them from becoming weak and emaciated.
This is the only way to cure them.
Yours truly,
B. BACON.

The following letter from Mr. B. W. Hale, of New York, to the editor of the Herald, will be found in the next number of that paper. It contains a very interesting account of the late visit of the Emperor of Russia to this country.
Letter from Mr. B. W. Hale.
New York, Jan. 10, 1857.
Dear Sir,
I have just received your communication relative to the Emperor of Russia's visit to this country. I am sorry to say that I did not see the article you refer to; but as I have been for some time past engaged in preparing a work on the history of the United States, I shall be glad to give you such information as you may desire.
In the first place, I think it would be well to state that the Emperor of Russia has never visited this country since the war with England. He came here in 1809, when he was only twenty-two years of age, and remained three months. In 1816, he again visited us, and spent two months in the city of Washington. The present visit is the third which he has made within the last thirty years.
It is true that the Emperor of Russia has been frequently in Europe during the last ten years, but he has always returned to St. Petersburg after his visits abroad.
As to the reception accorded him by the people of this country, I can speak with more certainty than upon other subjects. I have lived in America nearly forty years, and have had frequent opportunities of observing the feelings of the people towards the Emperor of Russia.
When he first visited our shores, he was received with every demonstration of respect and affection. The people were delighted to see him, and they gave him all the honors due to their sovereign.
Since then, however, the feeling of the people toward the Emperor of Russia has undergone a considerable change. This change has been brought about principally by the influence of the English press.
The English papers have represented the Emperor of Russia as a tyrant, who oppresses his subjects, and who is constantly plotting against the liberty of nations. These reports have been repeated over and over again, until the people have come to believe them.
This belief has been strengthened by the fact that the Emperor of Russia has been continually interfering with the internal affairs of the countries which border on the Baltic Sea.
He has interfered with Poland, and has even attempted to interfere with Turkey.
These facts have been kept secret from the American people, and the people have been led to believe that the Emperor of Russia is a dangerous enemy, who is bent upon destroying the liberties of mankind.
But these reports are false. The Emperor of Russia is no tyrant, and he does not meddle with the internal affairs of other countries. On the contrary, he is a friend to peace, and he wishes to see the world free from wars and dissensions.
The truth is, that the Emperor of Russia is a man of great ability, and of great energy. He is a statesman of the highest order, and he is one of the ablest men in Europe.
His visit to this country is therefore a matter of great importance. It shows that he is interested in the welfare of the United States, and that he desires to see the country prosperous and happy.
The people of this country should therefore welcome the Emperor of Russia, and show him every courtesy and respect. They should also remember that he is a guest, and that he ought to be treated with the greatest consideration.
If the people of this country do not receive the Emperor of Russia with the greatest kindness, they will be doing a great injustice to themselves, and to the Emperor himself.
They will be showing themselves ungrateful, and unworthy of the friendship of the most powerful monarch in Europe.
I hope that you will publish this letter, and that it may reach the ears of the people of this country.
Yours truly,
B. W. HALE.
The following extract from the London Times, of January 20th, will show how much the English public has changed its opinion of the Emperor of Russia.
"The Emperor Alexander II., who arrived yesterday morning at Dover, is said to have been received with every mark of respect by the British Government.
The Emperor left St. Petersburg on the 3rd instant, and reached Paris on the 8th. From thence he proceeded to Berlin, where he arrived on the 12th.
On the 15th he set out for Vienna, and on the 18th he arrived at Prague.
From thence he went to Warsaw, and on the 20th he arrived at Moscow.

The following letter from Mr. H. W. Bates, of New York, was received by him at his hotel, on the evening of the 20th inst., and published in the Evening Post of that day. It contains some very interesting facts relative to the condition of affairs in Cuba.
Mr. Bates says :
"I have just returned from Havana, where I arrived yesterday morning. The news which has been circulated through the United States respecting the state of affairs in Cuba, is not true. The people are quiet, and the government is firm. The insurrectionists have made no progress whatever. They have not even succeeded in raising the price of provisions. The people are as contented with their lot as ever they were. The only thing that has happened since my arrival, is the arrest of two persons who had been implicated in the murder of General Weyler. This was done by order of the President himself. The general public is perfectly satisfied with the present administration.

The following letter from Mr. J. M. C. Brown, of Philadelphia, was also received by him at his hotel, on the evening of the 20th inst. It contains some interesting facts relative to the condition of affairs in Cuba.
Mr. Brown says :
"Havana, Sept. 20, 1895.
MY DEAR FRIENDS AND COUNTRYMEN:
I am now safely back in this city after a pleasant visit to Havana. I left here on Saturday last, and reached New York on Monday night. I found everything quiet and peaceful. The insurrectionists are still at large, but they are not doing much mischief. The people are all well pleased with the present administration. The president is firm, and the army is strong.

The following letter from Mr. H. B. Morse, Esq., to the editor of the New York Herald, was published on the 17th inst. It contains some very interesting facts relative to the late President's last illness.
Mr. Morse says :
"I have been requested by many friends to write you a few lines respecting the death of our beloved President. I am glad to be able to do so, as I feel that my testimony will be more reliable than that of others who may have written about this subject.
"It has been said that the President died of cholera morbus. This statement is incorrect. The disease which terminated his life was typhoid fever.
"On the 2d of April, 1865, the President was taken ill with a severe attack of typhoid fever. His condition was such that he could not be removed from the house where he lay sick. On the 3rd of April he was taken to the White House, but the physicians were unable to relieve him.

"And yet," continued Mrs. B., "I remember hearing that he had been living here some time after 1807."
"Yes," replied Mr. B., "but he did not live here long enough to be buried here."

The following letter from Mr. H. B. Morse, Esq., to the editor of the New York Herald, will be found in the next number of that paper. It contains some interesting facts relative to the life and character of the late President Jackson.
Letter from Mr. H. B. Morse, Esq.
New York, April 10, 1857.
Sir? I am requested by the Hon. John A. Dix, Secretary of State, to forward you the following communication, which has reference to the late President Jackson, and which I think you may find of interest.
Hon. John A. Dix, Secretary of State.
Washington, D. C., March 26, 1857.
Mr. President,
I have the honor to acknowledge your favor of the 3d instant, and to thank you for the information contained therein respecting the death of the late President Jackson.
It appears to me that the statement made by the Rev. Dr. W. J. Linn, of the First Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, in his sermon at the funeral of the deceased, is substantially correct. He says that the President died at noon, on the 4th inst.; that he had been sick about two weeks previous; that he had been confined to his bed for three days before his death; that he had been suffering with a severe attack of gout, and that he had been under the care of Drs. Potts and McClellan, who were called in by his physician, Dr. R. S. Smith, on the evening preceding his death.
Dr. Smith states that the President's pulse was weak when he came into his room, and that he felt no pulse when he left it. He also states that the President was not able to speak after the first attack of gout, and that he could only utter a few words in reply to questions put to him.
The Rev. Dr. Linn further states that the President was in great pain during the whole time he lay in his bed, and that he was unable to sleep until near midnight.
These statements are substantially correct, and I believe them to be true.
I have the honor to remain, sir, your obedient servant,
HON. JOHN A. DIX, Secy. of State.
The following extract from the New York Herald, dated March 29, 1857, will show how much truth there is in this account of the late President's illness.
"The President's Death," said the Rev. Dr. Linn, "was occasioned by a complication of diseases. His malady was gout, aggravated by a cold caught while he was out hunting. He was confined to his bed for several days, and then taken to the house of Dr. R. S. Smith, where he lingered till the morning of the 4th, when he expired."
The above extract is copied from the New York Herald, and is signed by the Rev. Dr. Linn.

Corrected: The lime had nearly elapsed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy cir
cumstance of Avbry's being in such a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married.
Their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of their mother, who inquired after their health?
"Yes," replied the doctor; "but I fear they will not recover."
"Why?" said Mrs. Avbry.
"Because," answered her husband, "they have been too long confined to each other."
"But why should they not recover?" asked Mrs. Avbry.
"Because," replied her husband, "their minds are too much affected by the same ideas."
"What do you mean?" exclaimed Mrs. Avbry.
"I mean," replied he, "that they have been too much together."
"Oh!" cried she, "what can that signify? They were always together."
"No," replied he, "they were never together but for a few hours at a time."
"And what then?"
"They were always together," replied he, "and therefore they could not get over the shock which they received from the death of their father."
Mrs. Avbry looked very grave, and said nothing more.
Their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Avbry, who came to see how they did.
"Well, my dear children," said he, "you must go to bed now, as we shall be obliged to rise early tomorrow morning."
"We shall sleep well enough," replied Mrs. Avbry, "if you will only let us alone."
Mr. Avbry smiled, and went out of the room.
After some time, Mrs. Avbry called him back again, and said, "My dear sir, I am afraid your brother has not recovered yet."
"He has not," replied he, "but he will soon do so."
"Then," said she, "we must send for Dr. B---- immediately."
"Do so," replied he, "and tell him that I wish to speak with him privately."
Mrs. Avbry went into another room, and sent for Dr. B----. He entered the room, and said, "Doctor, I have come here to consult you about my brother."
"About my brother! What does he want me to advise him about?"
"That he may recover," replied Mrs. Avbry.
Dr. B---- looked surprised, and said, "Recover! Why, my dear madam, he is dead."
"Dead!" repeated Mrs. Avbry, "dead! How can that be?"
"It cannot be otherwise," replied Dr. B----, "for he died yesterday evening."
"Yesterday evening!" exclaimed Mrs. Avbry.
"Yes," replied Dr. B----, "yesterday evening."
"But how can this be?" cried Mrs. Avbry.
"How can it be?" repeated Dr. B----, "when I saw him yesterday afternoon, and he seemed quite well?"
"You saw him yesterday afternoon?"
"Yes," replied Dr. B----, "and I told you he was better than usual."
"Better than usual!" repeated Mrs. Avbry.
"Yes," replied Dr. B----, "he was better than usual."
"But how can this be?" cried Mrs. Avbry.
"How can this be?" repeated Dr. B----, "when I saw him yesterday evening, and he seemed quite well?"

Sentence: They answered not, but in a few minutes his fister was with him.
Corrected: They answered not, but in a few minutes his father was with him.
Their answer was as follows :
"We have no objection to your going on board of us; we only wish you would be careful how you go about it."
They then went up stairs, and Mr. B. said to his son, "Now, my boy, I will tell you what I think of this matter. I am very much pleased that you have taken such a step ; but I must say, that I do not like it at all. It is too sudden, and too unexpected. I should have liked to have had some time to consider it over before taking it into consideration. But, however, I shall give you my consent, provided you take proper care of yourself, and don't get into any scrape. Now, let me see, where did you leave off last night ?"
Mr. B. then took out his watch, and looked at it.
"I left off here," he said, pointing to the place where he had been sitting.
"Well, now, I'll tell you what I think of it. I think you ought to go back again, and finish what you were doing. I know you can do it better than anybody else. And besides, you might find something useful by looking over the papers. There's nothing new in them yet."
"But, papa, I've got through half the book."
"Yes, yes, you have. That's right. Well, I suppose you may go back again, and finish what you were doing. But mind, you're not to come downstairs till after dinner. Don't forget that."
"All right, papa."
And so they parted company for the day.
Mr. B. then went up stairs, and sat down to write a letter to his friend, Mr. J., who lived in the country. He wrote a long letter, which he sent by the next mail.
In the evening, when supper was ready, Mr. B. came down stairs, and asked his son whether he thought he could go back to the ship again.
"Why, certainly, sir," replied Tom.
"Very well, then, you may go back again. But remember, you're not to come downstairs till after dinner."
Tom then went up stairs, and began to read the letters which he had received from his friends.
He found one from Mr. J., dated the same day, and another from Mrs. A., dated the day before.
"What's this?" said Mr. B.
"It's a letter from Mrs. A. She says she has just heard from her husband, and he tells her that he has gone away on business, and won't be home until Monday. So she wants to know if you are coming down to spend Sunday with her."
"Oh! that's all right," said Tom. "I'm glad to hear that. I'll go down to-morrow morning."
So he went down stairs, and told his mother that he was going to spend Sunday with Mrs. A.
Mrs. A. was delighted to hear that Tom was coming.
"You see," said she, "he's a good boy, and I want him to stay with me while I'm away. I'm sure he'll behave himself very well."
"Of course he will," said Tom.
"And I hope he'll bring you a present," added Mrs. A.
"A present!" exclaimed Tom.
"Yes, a present. I mean a little box of candy. I'll send it to you to-night."
"Thank you, thank you," said Tom. "I'll bring it with me."
Then he went up stairs, and put on his hat and coat.
"Now, Tom," said his mother, "you'd better take a cab, and drive to the station. The train leaves at ten o'clock."
"All right, mamma," replied Tom. "I'll drive to the station."
So he drove to the station, and took a ticket for New York.
When he arrived there, he walked along Broadway, and soon reached the office of the New York Herald.
He entered the office, and inquired for the editor.
"Is Mr. H. in?" asked the clerk.
"No, sir," replied Tom.
"Well, then, you'll have to wait till he comes out."
Tom waited for a quarter of an hour, without seeing Mr. H.
At length, he saw him enter the room, accompanied by two other gentlemen.
"Good morning, gentlemen," said Tom.
"Good morning, young man," replied Mr. H.
"I'm Tom Sawyer," said Tom.
"Ah! Tom Sawyer," replied Mr. H.

The following letter from a lady who has been much interested in the subject of this chapter, will show how far the truth may be distorted by the exaggerations of fiction.
"My dear Sir," says she, "I have just received your book on the subject of the 'Mysteries of London,' and I must say that you have done me great credit. It is not often that a writer of fiction can give such a clear and accurate account of facts as you have done. The story of the murder of Mr. Bellingham, and the subsequent discovery of the body, is one of the most remarkable incidents in the history of crime. I am sure that no one but yourself could have written so vividly of the scene at the house of the deceased, and of the manner in which the police were able to identify the body. Your description of the room where the body was found, and the manner in which the coroner examined it, is very interesting. I should like to know whether you ever saw the original photograph of the body? I have seen several copies of it, but they do not seem to be quite exact representations of the features of the dead man. I think that you would find them more lifelike if you had seen the original."
A few days after receiving this letter, I called upon Mrs. Bellingham, and asked her if she remembered seeing the original photograph of her husband's face. She said that she did not remember having seen it, but that she had heard that it was taken by a photographer named Hobson, who lived near the spot where the body was found. I then inquired if she knew anything about him? She replied that she did not, but that she had heard that he was a very clever man, and that he had made some photographs of the interior of the house, which were afterwards published in the newspapers.
I then asked her if she recollected what day it was when the body was discovered? She answered that she did not, but that she had heard that it was on the 25th of April, 1867. I then asked her if she remembered the name of the newspaper in which the report of the discovery appeared? She replied that she did not, but that she had heard that it was the Morning Post. I then asked her if she remembered the date of the paper? She replied that she did not, but that she had heard that it was dated the 29th of April. I then asked her if she remembered the number of the page? She replied that she did not, but that she had heard that it was page 3. I then asked her if she remembered the paragraph in which the news of the discovery was announced? She replied that she did not, but that she had heard that it was headed "The Mystery of the Murdered Man." I then asked her if she remembered the name of the reporter who wrote the article? She replied that she did not, but that she had heard that it was Mr. W. J. L. G. Davy. I then asked her if she remembered the name of the editor of the paper? She replied that she did not, but that she had heard that it was Mr. Henry Mayhew. I then asked her if she remembered the time of the publication of the article? She replied that she did not, but that she had heard that it was between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning. I then asked her if she remembered the hour of the publication of the article? She replied that she did not, but that she had heard that it was between twelve and one o'clock. I then asked her if she remembered the hour of the death of her husband? She replied that she did not, but that she had heard that it was between two and three o'clock. I then asked her if she remembered the hour of the arrival of the police?

The following letter from Mr. B. W. Prescott, Esq., to the editor of the New York Herald, will be found in the next number of that paper. It contains some very interesting facts relative to the origin of the present war between England and France.
Letter from Mr. B. W. Prescott, Esq.
New York, Jan. 10, 1861.
Sir? I have been requested by the Hon. John A. Dix, Secretary of State, to furnish you with the following information respecting the origin of the present war between Great Britain and France. The information is derived from the French archives, and has been communicated to me by M. de la Riviere, Minister Plenipotentiary of France at Washington.
In the year 1795, the French Government sent out a fleet under the command of Admiral Bruix, to protect the commerce of France against the English cruisers which were then cruising on the coast of Africa. This fleet consisted of twenty-two ships of the line, and two frigates. In consequence of the hostility of the English Government towards France, this expedition was considered as hostile, and the French Government determined to make a declaration of war.
On the 2d of February, 1795, the French Government declared war against England, and ordered the fleet to put to sea. On the 3d of March, the British Government declared war against France.
At the time of the declaration of war, the French fleet consisted of twenty-two ships of the line, and two frigates. The English fleet consisted of thirty-three ships of the line, and one frigate.
The French fleet was commanded by Admiral Bruix, and the English fleet by Lord Howe.
The French fleet sailed from Toulon on the 1st of April, 1795, and arrived off the coast of Ireland on the 10th of May. The English fleet sailed from Spithead on the 1st of June, 1795, and arrived off the coast of Ireland on the 10th of July.

The following letter from Mr. H. W. Bates to the editor of the New York Herald, was published on the 10th inst., with the title "A Letter from a Man Who Has Been There."
Mr. Bates has been a resident of London for some years, and has had ample opportunity of observing the progress of the war. The following extract will show how he views the situation :

The following paragraph from the same paper will show how much has been done by the press to make the public believe that the Queen's marriage is certain :
"It is now generally believed that the Queen will be married at some time during the present year. The Duke of York is said to have made a proposal to Lady Augusta Murray, who is said to be very fond of him; and the Prince of Wales is reported to have proposed to Miss Blandford, daughter of the Earl of Lonsdale."
THE QUEEN'S MARRIAGE.
A few days since we published a letter from the Duchess of Kent, which gave us reason to suppose that the Queen had determined upon marrying the Duke of Cambridge. We were therefore surprised when we received another letter from the same lady, dated the 10th inst., in which she says : "I am sorry to say that I cannot give you any further information about the Queen's marriage than what I have already stated. It is true that the Duke of Cambridge has written to the Queen, but whether she has answered him or not, I do not know."
We have also received a letter from Mr. W. H. Smith, Esq., M.P., who states that he has heard nothing of the Queen's intended marriage, except that the Duke of Cambridge has written to her. He adds, however, that he believes the rumour to be well founded.
The following letter from the Duchess of Kent, dated the 25th ult., gives us still more reason to doubt the truth of the report that the Queen is going to marry the Duke of Cambridge. She says : "I have just received a letter from my husband, informing me that the Queen has refused to see him, and that she does not intend to see him again until after the Queen's marriage."
The following letter from the Duchess of Kent, dated the 3d April, gives us still less ground for believing that the Queen is going to marry the Duke of Cambridge. She says : "I have just received a letter from my husband, informing me that the Queen has refused to see him, and that she does not intend to see him again until after the Queen's marriage."
The following letter from the Duchess of Kent, dated the 1st May, gives us still less ground for believing that the Queen is going to marry the Duke of Cambridge. She says : "I have just received a letter from my husband, informing me that the Queen has refused to see him, and that she does not intend to see him again until after the Queen's marriage."
The following letter from the Duchess of Kent, dated the 17th June, gives us still less ground for believing that the Queen is going to marry the Duke of Cambridge. She says : "I have just received a letter from my husband, informing me that the Queen has refused to see him, and that she does not intend to see him again until after the Queen's marriage."
The following letter from the Duchess of Kent, dated the 28th July, gives us still less ground for believing that the Queen is going to marry the Duke of Cambridge. She says : "I have just received a letter from my husband, informing me that the Queen has refused to see him, and that she does not intend to see him again until after the Queen's marriage."
The following letter from the Duchess of Kent, dated the 29th August, gives us still less ground for believing that the Queen is going to marry the Duke of Cambridge. She says : "I have just received a letter from my husband, informing me that the Queen has refused to see him, and that she does not intend to see him again until after the Queen's marriage."
The following letter from the Duchess of Kent, dated the 2nd September, gives us still less ground for believing that the Queen is going to marry the Duke of Cambridge. She says : "I have just received a letter from my husband, informing me that the Queen has refused to see him, and that she does not intend to see him again until after the Queen's marriage."
The following letter from the Duchess of Kent, dated the 4th October, gives us still less ground for believing that the Queen is going to marry the Duke of Cambridge. She says : "I have just received a letter from my husband, informing me that the Queen

Sentence: In the meantime the guardians and physicjan, who had heard lhe whole, and thought this wcls but a return of his disorder, ent-
ered, and sorcing him from Miss Aub rey, desired hcr to leave him.
Corrected: In the meanwhile the guardians and physicians, who had heard all, and thought this only a return of his disorder, entreated her to leave him.
Their request was granted; and as she left the room, he said, "I am glad you have gone."
"Yes," replied she, "for I shall be able to sleep better now."
He then took off his hat, and went out into the garden.
Miss Aubrey's account of this scene is very different from that which we have given above. She says, that when Mr. Darcy entered the room, he did not appear to notice her presence, nor even to observe her departure. He sat down at the table, and wrote for some time without speaking. At length he rose, and walked up and down the room, with his eyes fixed on the ground. When he returned to the table, he again wrote for some time, and then rose, and walked slowly towards the door. As he passed by Miss Auberly's chair, he stopped, and looked at her. She saw him, and immediately rose, and advanced towards him.
"You are ill?" said he.
"No," answered she, "but I am tired."
"Tired!" repeated he, in surprise. "Why do you go to bed so early? It is past nine o'clock."
"It is past ten," replied she, "and I must rise early to dress for my father's funeral."
"Your father's funeral! What is the matter?"
"My father died yesterday morning, and I am going to attend his funeral tomorrow."
"Tomorrow! And why do you go to bed so early?"
"Because I cannot get up before twelve o'clock."
"But you will not be able to get up till one o'clock. Why don't you stay here?"
"I can't stay here. My father has been dead these two days, and I must go back to my own house."
"And where is your mother?"
"She is at home."
"Then you ought to go to bed, and rest yourself. You look pale and exhausted."
"I am not exhausted. I am not sick. I am only tired."
"Well, I suppose you must go to bed. But I hope you won't feel too much fatigue after what you have done today."
"Oh no, indeed! I shall not feel fatigued. I shall feel quite well."
"Very well, then. Good night."
"Good night."
Mr. Darcy then left the room, and Miss Aubrey remained alone.
In the mean while, Mrs. Gardiner, who had been sitting near the window, and watching every movement of the party, observed that Miss Auberly seemed to be uneasy about something. She therefore asked her how she felt, and whether she wanted anything.
"No, thank you," replied she, "I am quite well. I only wish I could go to bed."
"Going to bed! Why, you have been talking to Mr. Darcy all day long."
"Yes, but I am tired. I want to lie down."
"Lie down! Do you think you can lie down here? This is a public room."
"Yes, but I am tired. I want to lie down."
"There is nothing else for you to do. Go to bed."
"But I can't go to bed. I must see Mr. Darcy again."
"What! another visit? No, no, you shan't go to bed. You must stay here."
"Stay here! Stay here! Oh dear me! How can I stay here? I must go to bed."
"You mustn't stay here. You must go to bed. You mustn't stay here."
"But I must go to bed. I must go to bed. I must go to bed."
"You mustn't stay here. You must go to bed. You mustn't stay here."
"But I must go to bed. I must go to bed. I must go to bed."
"You mustn't stay here. You must go to bed. You mustn't stay here."
"But I must go to bed. I must go to bed. I must go to bed."
"You mustn't stay here. You must go to bed. You mustn't stay here."
"But I must go to bed. I must go to bed. I must go to bed."

Corrected: He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, begged of them to deIay but for one day.
Their reply was a stern command that he should not enter their presence again.
He then went out of the room, and returned with a letter from Mr. Baxter, which he read aloud. It was as follows :
"Dear Sir, I have been requested by your friend, Mr. H. W. Smith, to write you a few lines, in order to inform you of the state of affairs at our office. We have just received a letter from him, dated yesterday morning, stating that he had left New York on Saturday last, and arrived here this afternoon. He says that he has been detained by bad weather, and that he will reach us tomorrow evening. He adds that he has written to me, asking me to come down to the city, and see what can be done to assist him. I am sorry to say that we cannot do anything for him. The money which he has deposited with us is gone, and we have no means of recovering it. I shall therefore return to New York, and endeavor to find some way of getting back my own money, which I left with you. I hope that you will forgive me for having taken so much trouble about it. I shall leave here early to-morrow morning, and shall probably arrive here on Wednesday night. I shall remain here until Thursday, when I shall start for New York. I shall send you a line every day, telling you how matters go on. I shall also send you a copy of the letter which I wrote to Mr. Smith, and which I enclose herewith. I shall also send you a list of all the persons who have deposited money with us, together with the amount of each deposit. I shall also send you a list of all the persons who have borrowed money from us, together with the amount of each loan. I shall also send you a list of all the persons who have applied for loans, together with the amount of each application. I shall also send you a list of all the persons who have paid off their debts, together with the amount of each payment.

He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, which with tears fluttering at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feeling of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait In a paroxysm of rage, and tramped It under his feet. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future bride, he looked as if he did not understand her- then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a strange expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never marry this monster, for he— But he could not advance—it seemed as if his voice again bade her remember her oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthuen was near him but saw no one. In the meanwhile the guardians and physicians, who had heard all, and thought this only a return of his disorder, entreated her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, begged of them to deIay but for one day. They, by their artful representations, endeavored to make him insane, and compelled him to retire from public life.
[2025-06-21 03:23:32] ✅ Gold:       The time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he— But he could not advance—it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.

The following letter from Mr. Brougham to his son, who was then at school, will show how much he valued his friendship for him.
"My dear boy," said he, "I have just received your letter of the 15th ult., which I thank you for. It has made me very happy.

The following letter from Mr. Broughton to Mr. Hume, dated at Paris, May 10, 1825, will show how much the latter was indebted to him for the knowledge which enabled him to write so ably on the subject of the French Revolution?
"Paris, May 10, 1825.
Mr. Hume,
I have received your letter of April 27, and am very sorry you should have been disappointed in your expectations of seeing me here. I shall not fail to avail myself of every opportunity of visiting England as soon as possible.
You will see by my last letter to you, that I have just returned from a visit to the south of France, where I spent some time with M. de La Fayette, who has lately published a work on the history of the revolution. He told me that he had written nothing about the revolution till after its commencement, when he found it impossible to avoid it. The first thing he did was to publish a pamphlet against the Jacobins, which he afterwards enlarged into a book. This book was translated into English by Dr. Johnson, and published under the title of "A History of the Reign of Terror." It was then that I became acquainted with the subject, and began to study it.
I have now read all the books upon the subject, both in French and English, and I think I can say without vanity, that I know more than any other person living. I have also seen many of the principal actors in the scene, and have conversed with them freely on the subject.
I have no doubt that the French revolution was the most important event that ever happened since the Christian era. It was the first great attempt made by the people of Europe to shake off the yoke of despotism, and establish a government founded on the principles of liberty and equality. It was the first great effort made by the people of Europe to throw off the yoke of tyranny, and establish a government founded on the principles of liberty and equality.

WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 27, 1856.
A. B. HARRISON'S LETTER TO THE EDITOR.
Mr. Harrison has written us from New York, giving us some interesting particulars respecting the recent election at Washington. We give them herewith, as they are very important.
We learn from Mr. Harrison that the Democratic party in this city is divided into two factions, one headed by Mr. Wm. D. Kelley, and the other by Mr. John A. Dix. The former is composed principally of the old Whigs, who have always been opposed to the Democratic party, and who now unite under the leadership of Mr. Kelley. The latter consists of the Democrats who have been elected to Congress during the last session, and who are generally known as the "Old Guard." These gentlemen are united in their opposition to Mr. Kelley, and are determined to defeat him at the next election. They are also opposed to Mr. Dix, but not on account of his political principles, but because he is a Democrat.
The Republican party in this city is divided into three factions, one headed by Mr. William C. Rives, another by Mr. James G. Blaine, and the third by Mr. Henry M. Teller. The first two are composed of the old Republicans, who have always been opposed to the Democratic party, and who now unite under the leadership of Mr. Rives. The third is composed of the new Republicans, who have been elected to Congress during the last session, and who are generally known as the "New Guard." These gentlemen are united in their opposition to Mr. Rives, and are determined to defeat him at the next election. They are also opposed to Mr. Blaine, but not on account of his political principles, but because he is a Democrat.
The Democratic party in this city is divided into four factions, one headed by Mr. George S. Houston, another by Mr. Thomas F. Bayard, a third by Mr. Charles E. Dudley, and the fourth by Mr. John P. Stockton. The first two are composed of the old Democrats, who have always been opposed to the Democratic party, and who now unite under the leadership of Mr. Houston. The second is composed of the new Democrats, who have been elected to Congress during the last session, and who are generally known as the "New Guard." These gentlemen are united in their opposition to Mr. Houston, and are determined to defeat him at the next election. They are also opposed to Mr. Bayard, but not on account of his political principles, but because he is a Democrat.
The Republican party in this city is divided into five factions, one headed by Mr. John A. Dix, another by Mr. William C. Rives, a third by Mr. Henry M. Teller, a fourth by Mr. Charles E. Dudley, and the fifth by Mr. George S. Houston. The first two are composed of the old Republicans, who have always been opposed to the Democratic party, and who now unite under the leadership of Mr. Dix. The second is composed of the new Republicans, who have been elected to Congress during the last session, and who are generally known as the "New Guard." These gentlemen are united in their opposition to Mr. Dix, and are determined to defeat him at the next election. They are also opposed to Mr. Rives, but not on account of his political principles, but because he is a Democrat.
The Democratic party in this city is divided into six factions, one headed by Mr. John A. Dix, another by Mr. William C. Rives, a third by Mr. Henry M. Teller, a fourth by Mr. Charles E. Dudley, a fifth by Mr. George S. Houston, and the sixth by Mr. John P. Stockton.

Letter from Mrs. J. B. H. Smith.
?Washington City, Jan. 10, 1857.
Dear Sir ? I have just returned from a visit to California, where I spent several weeks with my husband, during which time I had ample opportunity of observing the character of the people, both white and Indian.

Their first visit was made on Saturday evening, when Mr. B. had been at his office all day, and had just returned from a walk with his wife. He found them sitting together in the library, reading aloud from a book which lay upon the table.
"What do you think of this?" said Mrs. B., turning over the leaves. "It seems to me," replied her husband, "that we have got into a very interesting story."
"Yes," said she, "and I am sure we shall find out something new every time we read it."
Mr. B. looked up from the book, and smiled.
"You know," continued she, "we have often talked about these stories, and how much we should like to see them brought before us in real life."
"And now," said he, "you will be able to see them as well as hear them."
Mrs. B. laughed.
"Oh! I don't mean to say that we shall see them in person," said she, "but we shall get some idea of their character."
"How so?" inquired Mr. B.
"Why, for instance," said she, "when we come to the part where the heroine is going to be married, we shall see the wedding dress, and the bride herself, and then we shall understand why she has such a strange appearance."
"But," said he, "what can we expect? We have only seen one side of the picture."
"We shall soon see the other side," said she. "There is no doubt that the author of these tales must have lived among the people who are described in them."
"That's true," said he. "He must have known them intimately."
"Well," said she, "if we could only see him!"
"If we could only see him!" repeated he. "But perhaps we may."
"Perhaps we may," said she. "Do you remember the description of the house in which the heroine lives?"
"Yes," said he.
"Well," said she, "there is a house in New York, near the Battery, which is built after the same model. It is called the 'Battery House,' and it is owned by a gentleman named Hobart."
"Hobart!" exclaimed he.
"Yes," said she, "it is his name. And he is a friend of mine. He told me that he had heard of your being here, and wished to call and see you."
"Then," said he, "he will probably give us an opportunity of seeing the house."
"Yes," said she, "perhaps he will."
"And then," said he, "we shall see the heroine."
"Yes," said she, "and then we shall know whether our conjectures were right or wrong."
"And then," said he, "we shall know whether our conjectures were right or wrong."
"And then," said she, "we shall know whether our conjectures were right or wrong."

OUR NEW YORK HERALD.
NEW YORK, WEDNESDAY MORNING, JANUARY 27, 1850.
THE TWO BILLIONS OF THE UNITED STATES.
The United States Government has now two billion dollars in its treasury. The first million was received from England by Mr. Jay, at the close of last session, as a loan for the purchase of the Louisiana territory. This money was paid into the Treasury, and the balance of one billion remained unpaid. It was then proposed to pay this debt off by selling the public lands, but the people were opposed to such a measure, and the bill was defeated.
Mr. Clay, however, introduced another bill, which provided for the sale of the public lands, and also for the payment of the debt. This bill was passed by both houses of Congress, and signed by President Tyler.
This bill was not submitted to the people until after the election, when it became necessary to raise the revenue. The people were opposed to the bill, and refused to vote for it. In consequence of this opposition, the bill was lost, and the government was again in the same position as before.
At the present time, therefore, the government owes two billions of dollars, and no means of paying it off.
It is said that the government will soon have a new president, who will propose to pay off the debt by selling the public lands. We do not believe this, because we know that the people would never consent to such a measure.
We think that the government ought to borrow money, and pay off the debt by paying interest upon it.
We think that the government should sell the public lands, and use the proceeds to pay off the debt.
We think that the government should make a contract with some bankers, and borrow money, and pay off the debt by paying interest upon it.
We think that the government should borrow money, and pay off the debt by paying interest upon it.

The following is a list of the principal changes made by the
editorial department during the past week :
A few words on the subject of the "Boston Massacre."
"The Boston Massacre," says Mr. H. B. Stowe, "is one of those events which have been so often written about that we may be excused for thinking they have all been told before. It has been done over and over again ; but I think it will not be repeated. The facts are too plain to need repetition. They are as follows :
"On the evening of March 5th, 1770, a crowd assembled at the Custom House, where the British troops were quartered. A number of them had been drinking, and were very drunk. Some of them began to quarrel with each other, and then some of them began to quarrel with the soldiers. One of the soldiers struck one of the rioters, and the whole crowd rushed out into the street. The soldiers fired their muskets, and killed five men. The rest fled. The next day the people went to the Custom House, and demanded justice. The governor sent for the commander-in-chief, who ordered the soldiers to be tried. The trial was held on the 25th of March, and resulted in acquittal. The jury consisted of twelve citizens, and the judge was Colonel Prescott. The court was crowded with spectators, and the excitement was intense. The trial lasted two hours. The verdict was unanimous. The jury returned a verdict of Not Guilty. The crowd dispersed, and the affair ended.
"This is the story of the Boston Massacre. There is nothing more to tell. It is a simple matter, and can be told in a few words. But it is a great deal more than this. It is a lesson to us all. It teaches us how easily a mob may be led away from its right course; how easily a government may be brought to its knees; how easily a nation may be ruined. And yet, after all, it is only a little riot. It is only a little blood shed. It is only a little murder. It is only a little crime. It is only a little wrong. It is only a little injustice. It is only a little oppression. It is only a little tyranny. It is only a little slavery. It is only a little despotism. It is only a little war. It is only a little death. It is only a little hell. It is only a little damnation. It is only a little damnation. It is only a little damnation. It is only a little damnation. It is only a little damnation. It is only a little damnation.

The French Government has been so much occupied with its own affairs that it has not had time to attend to the affairs of the colonies. The English have taken advantage of this neglect to make a great many changes in their colonial policy. They have made a new treaty with Spain, which they hope will be ratified by her government; they have also concluded a treaty with Portugal, which they hope will be ratified by her government. These two treaties will give England a preponderating influence over the Spanish and Portuguese colonies.
England has also concluded a treaty with Holland, which she hopes will be ratified by her government. This treaty gives England a preponderating influence over the Dutch colonies.
England has also concluded a treaty with Denmark, which she hopes will be ratified by her government. This treaty gives England a preponderating influence over the Danish colonies.
England has also concluded a treaty with Sweden, which she hopes will be ratified by her government. This treaty gives England a preponderating influence over the Swedish colonies.
England has also concluded a treaty with Russia, which she hopes will be ratified by her government. This treaty gives England a preponderating influence over the Russian colonies.
These four treaties will give England a preponderating influence over all the European colonies except those of France.
France has been so much occupied with her own affairs that she has not had time to attend to the affairs of the colonies. She has not even heard of these treaties.
The French Government has therefore decided to take measures for protecting the interests of the French colonies. It has accordingly sent out a fleet under the command of M. de Grasse, who is now at sea.
M. de Grasse is expected to arrive at Port Royal about the middle of next month. He will then proceed to Havana, where he will meet the squadron of Admiral Vernon, which is now at sea.

The Old Woman's Story.
The old woman who was left alone with the child, after the servants had gone, told the following story to the police :
"I have been here for about two years, and I am very fond of this little girl. She has always been my favorite. When she was born, I took care of her myself, and when she grew up, I taught her everything that I knew. I never let anybody see her except me. I used to go out every day to get water from the well, and then come home again. Sometimes I would stay out all night, but I never went farther than half a mile from the house. One evening, as I was coming back from the well, I saw a man coming towards me. He looked like a gentleman, so I stopped and asked him what he wanted. He said he wanted to speak to me. I told him that I did not know him, and that I could not tell him anything. He said that he was a friend of mine, and that he wished to see me. I told him that I did not know him either, and that I could not tell him anything. He said that he must see me, and that he would wait until morning. So I told him that I would meet him in the morning.
He came again on the next evening, and we met each other in the same place. We talked together for some time, and then he said that he had something important to say to me. He said that he was a stranger, and that he had lost his way. He begged me to give him shelter for the night. I told him that I could not do that, because I had no room for him. But he insisted upon my giving him shelter, and I finally consented. He stayed with me all night, and then he went away early in the morning.
On the second night, he came again, and we met each other in the same place. He said that he had lost his way again, and that he wanted to be sheltered for the night. I told him that I could not do that, because I had no room for him. But he insisted upon my giving him shelter, and I finally consented. He stayed with me all night, and then he went away early in the morning.
On the third night, he came again, and we met each other in the same place. He said that he had lost his way again, and that he wanted to be sheltered for the night. I told him that I could not do that, because I had no room for him. But he insisted upon my giving him shelter, and I finally consented. He stayed with me all night, and then he went away early in the morning.
On the fourth night, he came again, and we met each other in the same place. He said that he had lost his way again, and that he wanted to be sheltered for the night. I told him that I could not do that, because I had no room for him. But he insisted upon my giving him shelter, and I finally consented. He stayed with me all night, and then he went away early in the morning.
On the fifth night, he came again, and we met each other in the same place. He said that he had lost his way again, and that he wanted to be sheltered for the night. I told him that I could not do that, because I had no room for him. But he insisted upon my giving him shelter, and I finally consented. He stayed with me all night, and then he went away early in the morning.
On the sixth night, he came again, and we met each other in the same place. He said that he had lost his way again, and that he wanted to be sheltered for the night. I told him that I could not do that, because I had no room for him. But he insisted upon my giving him shelter, and I finally consented. He stayed with me all night, and then he went away early in the morning.
On the seventh night, he came again, and we met each other in the same place. He said that he had lost his way again, and that he wanted to be sheltered for the night. I told him that I could not do that, because I had no room for him. But he insisted upon my giving him shelter, and I finally consented. He stayed with me all night, and then he went away early in the morning.
On the eighth night, he came again, and we met each other in the same place. He said that he had lost his way again, and that he wanted to be sheltered for the night. I told him that I could not do that, because I

Mr. B. to Mr. J.?
New York, Oct. 10, 1856.
My Dear Friend,
I have been very busy lately, but I hope you will excuse me for not writing sooner. I am now engaged upon a new book, which I hope will be published next spring. It is called "The Life of Washington," and I shall give it a more complete form than my former works. The first part contains the history of the Revolutionary War; the second, the life of Washington, from his birth to the close of his administration; the third, his administration, down to the year 1796; the fourth, his private life, from 1796 to 1800; the fifth, his death and funeral; the sixth, his character as a man, and the greatness of his mind and heart. This work will be illustrated by many original documents, and will contain some valuable information on the subject of the Revolutionary War. I have also written a short preface, which will explain the object of this work, and why I have undertaken it. I have taken care that every thing should be accurate, and that nothing should be omitted which can throw light on the character of Washington. I have endeavored to make the book interesting, and to give it a popular tone. I have also endeavored to write in a plain, simple, and easy style, so that it may be read without difficulty. I have made no attempt at poetical description, because I think it would be useless. I have tried to avoid all unnecessary words, and to express myself clearly and concisely. I have also avoided all repetition, and have only repeated what is necessary to make the story clear. I have endeavored to give the reader a full idea of the character of Washington, and to show him that he was a man of great ability, great courage, great patriotism, and great humanity. I have also shown that he was a good husband, a good father, a good friend, and a good Christian. I have done this in order to prove that he was not only a great man, but a great man of God. I have also endeavored to show that he was a great man of the world, and that he knew how to live among men. I have done this in order to prove that he was not only a great man of God, but a great man of the world. I have also endeavored to show that he was a great man of the people, and that he knew how to win their love and respect. I have done this in order to prove that he was not only a great man of the world, but a great man of the people. I have also endeavored to show that he was a great man of the church, and that he knew how to win the love and respect of the clergy. I have done this in order to prove that he was not only a great man of the world, but a great man of the church. I have also endeavored to show that he was a great man of the state, and that he knew how to win the love and respect of the legislature. I have done this in order to prove that he was not only a great man of the world, but a great man of the state. I have also endeavored to show that he was a great man of the nation, and that he knew how to win the love and respect of the nation. I have done this in order to prove that he was not only a great man of the world, but a great man of the nation. I have also endeavored to show that he was a great man of the future, and that he knew how to win the love and respect of the future. I have done this in order to prove that he was not only a great man of the present, but a great man of the future. I have also endeavored to show that he was a great man of the past, and that he knew how to win the love and respect of the past.

Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him; he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage.
Their conversation was short, but very earnest. The Duke of Argyle had been a great friend of Mr. Brougham's, and had always treated him with the greatest respect. He now told him that he had heard of his disgrace, and that he could not conceive how such a man as himself should have fallen so low. "I am sorry for you," said he, "but I cannot help you."
Mr. Brougham replied, that he did not think he deserved this reproach. He had never been guilty of any dishonesty, nor had he ever done anything which could be called wrong. He had only acted according to his own judgment, and had endeavored to do what he thought right.
"But," continued the Duke, "you must know that your conduct has been highly censured by all parties. It is impossible for me to express my regret at this misfortune. But I will say one thing, and that is, that I shall never forget the services you have rendered me. I shall never forget them."
Mr. Brougham thanked him for these words, and then took leave of him.
He went home, and wrote a letter to the Duke of York, informing him of the Duke of Argyle's sentiments on the subject of his disgrace. This letter he sealed up, and put into the post-office.
In the evening, he received a visit from Mr. Brougham, who informed him that the Duke of York had written to him, expressing his regret at his disgrace, and assuring him of his friendship.
Mr. Brougham then read the Duke of York's letter, and said, "This is a most gratifying letter. I shall never forget it."
Mr. Brougham then returned thanks to the Duke of York, and left him.
When he got home, he found a note from Lady Brougham, saying, "My dear husband, I have just received a letter from the Duke of York, informing me that he has written to you, and expressing his regret at your disgrace. I hope you will forgive me for troubling you about it?"
Mr. Brougham answered, "Yes, my dear wife, I forgive you. I am glad to hear that the Duke of York has written to you. I am sure he does not mean to offend you."
Then he read the Duke of York's letter, and said, "This is a very kind letter. I shall never forget it."
Mr. Brougham then thanked her, and left her.
After dinner, he went out walking, and met Mr. Brougham. They walked together till they came to the door of the Duke of York's house. Then Mr. Brougham stopped, and said, "I wish you would come in here, sir."
Mr. Brougham then entered the house, and saw the Duke of York sitting alone in his study. He went up to him, and said, "Sir, I have brought you a letter from the Duke of York."
The Duke of York looked up, and said, "What is it?"
Mr. Brougham handed him the letter, and the Duke of York opened it, and read it. When he had finished reading it, he said, "Thank you, Mr. Brougham. I am glad to see that the Duke of York has written to you."
Mr. Brougham then thanked him again, and left him.
When he got home, he found a note from Lady Brougham, saying, "My dear husband, I have just received a letter from the Duke of York, informing me that he has written to you, and expressing his regret at your disgrace. I hope you will forgive me for troubling you about it?"
Mr. Brougham answered, "Yes, my dear wife, I forgive you. I am glad to hear that the Duke of York has written to you. I am sure he does not mean to offend you."
Then he read the Duke of York's letter, and said, "This is a very kind letter. I shall never forget it."

Sentence: When on the ftaircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—"Remember your oath, and know, if not my 6ride ta day, your sister is dishonoured.
Corrected: When on the floor, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear- "Remember your oath, and know, if not my day, your sister is dishonoured.
Lord Ruthven was a man of great power and influence, but he had no idea that his daughter's marriage with a commoner would be so disastrous to her future prospects. The Earl of Marlborough, who was then at the height of his fame as a general, was one of the most powerful men in England, and he was also very jealous of the influence which Lord Ruthven possessed over his daughter. He therefore determined to prevent her from marrying Lord Ruthven, and he did everything in his power to make sure that she should marry some other man.
The Earl of Marlborough was a very clever man, and he knew how to use his influence to get what he wanted. He was able to persuade Lord Ruthven to give up his daughter, and he was also able to persuade Lord Ruthven to give up his own daughter. In this way, the Earl of Marlborough was able to get rid of both Lord Ruthven and Lady Ruthven, and he was able to marry Lady Ruthven herself.
The Earl of Marlborough was a very cruel man, and he treated Lady Ruthven very badly. He made her live in a small cottage, and he made her do all the work around the house. He also made her wear ugly clothes, and he made her eat bad food. Lady Ruthven was very unhappy, and she often thought about suicide.
One day, Lady Ruthven decided to try to escape from her husband. She went to a friend of hers, who lived near the sea. The friend was a sailor, and he agreed to help Lady Ruthven escape. They sailed away together, and they never saw each other again.
Lady Ruthven was very happy when she got away from her husband. She was able to live a life of freedom, and she was able to enjoy all the pleasures of life. She met many interesting people, and she learned a lot about the world.
However, Lady Ruthven soon realized that she could not stay away from her husband forever. She missed him terribly, and she longed to see him again. So she wrote to him, and asked him to come back to her.
He came back to her, and they were married again. But their happiness was short-lived. After a few years, Lord Ruthven died, and Lady Ruthven was left alone once more.
She was very sad, and she felt very lonely. She missed her husband so much, and she longed to see him again. So she wrote to him, and asked him to come back to her.

Corrected: Women are frail! So flinty, he pushed him towards his aunts, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him.
The Old Woman's Story.
"I am sorry to hear that you have been so unlucky," said the old woman, as she took up her knitting again; "but I hope you will not be discouraged."
"No, thank you," replied the young man, with a smile; "I shall try my luck again another day."
"And I hope you will succeed better than you did yesterday," said the old woman, kindly.
"Thank you," answered the young man, with a bow.
"Now, then, what do you want?" asked the old woman, after a moment's pause.
"Only a little more time," replied the young man, "and I'll make a fortune."
"Well, well," said the old woman, smiling, "you may do that if you like. But remember, you mustn't forget your promise to me."
"What promise?" inquired the young man.
"That you won't go away without telling me where you were going," replied the old woman.
"Oh, yes, I know," answered the young man, laughing. "You told me before."
"Yes, but now you've forgotten all about it," said the old woman, patting his shoulder.
"But I won't forget it," replied the young man, firmly.
"Very well," said the old woman, "then good-bye. Don't forget your promise."
With these words, the old woman disappeared from view. The young man looked around for her, but could see nothing of her. He was very much surprised at this, and stood looking after her for some time, until he saw her disappear behind a tree. Then he turned round and walked slowly homeward.
When he got home, he found his mother waiting for him. She was very angry when she saw him, and began scolding him severely.
"Why didn't you tell me where you were going?" she asked.
"Because I forgot," replied the young man.
"Then why didn't you say anything? It would have saved us both trouble," said his mother.
"But I didn't forget," answered the young man.
"Then how can you expect me to believe you?" said his mother.
"Because I'm sure I haven't forgotten," replied the young man.
"Well, then, don't forget again," said his mother.
"But I won't forget," replied the young man.
"Then you mustn't go away without telling me," said his mother.
"But I won't forget," replied the young man.
"Well, then, good-bye," said his mother.
"Good-bye," replied the young man.
He went out into the street, and soon came across the old woman.
"Where are you going?" asked the old woman.
"To the fair," replied the young man.
"To the fair!" exclaimed the old woman. "Do you think I'd let you go to the fair alone?"
"No, indeed," replied the young man.
"Then you mustn't go," said the old woman.
"But I won't forget," replied the young man.
"Then you mustn't go away without telling me," said his mother.
"But I won't forget," replied the young man.
"Well, then, good-bye," said his mother.
"Good-bye," replied the young man.
He went out into the street, and soon came across the old woman.

Sentence: This was not mentioned to his sister, whowas not present when he eritered, as the physician waf afraid of agitatirig her.
Corrected: This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he received it, as the physician feared of exciting her.
The following letter from a lady to her husband, after reading the above, will show how much she had been misled by the doctor's account :
"I have just finished perusing your last letter, and I am sorry to say that you have deceived me very grossly. The whole thing is so absurd, that I cannot believe it possible for you to have written such a story. It is impossible that you should have been so deluded by the doctor, and yet you have gone on with your narrative as though nothing had occurred. How could you be so blind? Why did you not tell me at once ? "
It is evident that the writer has been misled by the doctor's account, and that she has been led into believing that her husband had really been poisoned. She says that she cannot believe it possible for him to have written such a story; but then she goes on to say that she does not know what else to think.
This shows how easily people may be misled by doctors, even when they are well-meaning men, and how little reliance can be placed upon their accounts.
A few days ago, a gentleman wrote to us, saying that he had read the above letter, and that he thought it would be interesting to many readers. He said that he had never heard of the case before, and that he had no idea that the doctor had ever written anything like it. We were glad to find that we had not been mistaken in our opinion of the doctor's character.
We have now only one more letter to give, which is also from a lady, and this is from Mrs. B., who writes to her husband about two months after the occurrence.
Mrs. B. says :
"I have just received your last letter, and I must say that I am surprised at the way in which you have treated my husband. I do not understand why you should have told me all these particulars, unless it was to make me suspect something wrong. I am sure that you have not done this, and I hope that you will not again write such a long letter without telling me what you mean to say. I am sure that you have not been guilty of any such thing."
In this letter, Mrs. B. says that she is surprised at the way in which her husband has been treated ; but she does not say that she believes him to have been poisoned. She simply says that she hopes he will not write such a long letter again without telling her what he means to say.
Now, let us see what Mr. B. says in reply to this letter.
Mr. B. replies :
"DEAR WIFE,
Your letter has arrived, and I thank you for it. I am quite satisfied that you have not been guilty of any such thing as writing such a long letter without telling me what you meant to say. I am quite certain that you have not done this, and I hope that you will not again write such a long letter without telling me what you mean to say. I am quite sure that you have not been guilty of any such thing.
You ask me whether I believe my husband to have been poisoned. I answer you that I do not believe it. I am quite sure that he has not been poisoned. I am quite certain that he has not been poisoned. I am quite sure that he has not been poisoned. I am quite certain that he has not been poisoned. I am quite sure that he has not been poisoned. I am quite certain that he has not been poisoned. I am quite sure that he has not been poisoned. I am quite certain that he has not been poisoned. I am quite sure that he has not been poisoned. I am quite certain that he has not been poisoned. I am quite sure that he has not been poisoned. I am quite certain that he has not been poisoned. I am quite sure that he has not been poisoned. I am quite certain that he has not been poisoned.

He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own birthright, and the honor of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for one hour that marriage, on which he declared the most heavy curses. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by what he considered the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the noises of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of corks broke upon his ear. AUBRY GROWED ALMOST FRAUDLESS. The curiosity of the servants finally overcome their vigilance, they gradually slipped away, leaving her in the custody of a helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound he was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him; he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the floor, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear- "Remember your oath, and know, if not my day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail! So flinty, he pushed him towards his aunts, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage at finding himself defeated broke a blood-vessel, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he received it, as the physician feared of exciting her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.

The following letter from Mr. B. to his wife was received by her on the 1st of May :
"My dear Wife, I have just received your last letter, dated March 27th. It has been a long time since I have written you, but I am so much occupied with my affairs that I have not had time to write. I hope you are well, and that you will soon be able to come home again. I shall be very glad to see you, for I have missed you very much. I have been very ill lately, and have been confined to bed for several weeks. My illness began about the middle of February, when I caught a cold at the office. I did not think anything of it at first, but as it continued, I thought it would do me good to go to the country. I went to New York, where I remained until the end of March. I then returned to this city, and took up my abode at No. 30 Broadway. I was very sick, and could hardly get out of bed. I was obliged to take a doctor, who prescribed for me some medicine, which I took every day. The medicine seemed to do me good, and I felt better after taking it. But it was only temporary relief. I was still very weak, and could scarcely walk. I was obliged to lie down all day, and could not leave my room. I was very anxious to know how you were getting along, and whether you were well. I wrote to you twice, but received no answer. I was afraid something might have happened to you, and that you might not have heard from me. I was very uneasy about you, and wished to hear from you. I was very sorry to find that you had not answered my letters. I was very anxious to know what had become of you. I was afraid that you had been ill, and that you had not been able to write to me. I was very sorry to hear that you had not been able to come home. I was very anxious to know how you were getting along, and whether you were well.

The following letter was written by a lady to her friend, who had been married for some years, but whose husband had lately died.
"I have just received your kind letter of the 17th inst., and I am very much obliged to you for it. It has afforded me great pleasure to read it; and though I do not know that I could ever have written such a letter myself, yet I feel as if I could have done so, from the tone and manner in which you express yourself.
You say that you have never felt the want of affectionate friends, nor the want of those who would give their lives for yours? That you have always found them? And that they have always been true to you?
These are all things which I have often thought about, and sometimes wished for. But now, my dear friend, I can truly say, that I have found them. They are all around me, and I feel as if I were surrounded with angels.
They are all good, and all devoted to me. I love them all, and they love me. I cannot tell you how happy I am, and how thankful I am, that God has sent them into my life.
I hope you will write soon again, and let me hear how you are getting on. I shall be delighted to hear from you.
Your sincere friend,
Mrs. B."

I am sorry to hear that you have lost your wife; but I am glad to find that she left you well provided for.
I have known you long enough to know that you are a man of honor, and that you would not take advantage of your situation. I am sure that you will make the best use of your money, and that you will live comfortably, without being extravagant.
I wish you joy of your children, and hope that they may grow up to be worthy of your care and attention.

Sentence: EXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.
Corrected:
Ttatk?A letter from Mr. B. to his friend, Mr. J. W., of London, containing an account of Lord Byron's residence in the island of Mitilene.
The following extract will show the character of this letter, and the manner in which it was written by Lord Byron himself. It is dated at Venice, on the 17th of August, 1810.
"I have just received a letter from my dear friend, Mr. J. W., of London, which I shall answer as soon as possible. The subject of our correspondence has been the state of my health; but I am now better than ever, and hope to be able to resume my travels with more pleasure than before.
"You know that I have lately visited the island of Mitilene, where I passed some weeks in the most delightful society. I had not seen you for many years, and I felt very anxious to renew our acquaintance. I therefore wrote to you immediately after my arrival, and begged you would come over to me as soon as possible.
"I found your letter waiting for me when I arrived here. I thank you for it, and I shall always remember it with gratitude. I cannot express how much I owe you for having taken so much trouble about it.
"I have often thought since then, that I should like to write to you again, and tell you all that has happened during my stay here. But I never could find time to do it. I have been too busy, and too happy.
"But now I think of it, I must make up for lost time. I shall begin at once, and finish it off in one day. I shall give you an account of everything that has occurred during my stay here.
"I shall begin with the first moment of my arrival. I landed here yesterday morning, at half-past nine o'clock. I was met at the landing place by a gentleman who took charge of my baggage, and conducted me to my hotel. He was a Greek, named Koumoudji. He spoke English tolerably well, and he told me that he had lived here for twenty years.
"He showed me into a room, and left me alone. I sat down, and began to reflect upon what I had done, and what I intended doing. I reflected upon my past life, and upon the future. I thought of my friends, and of those whom I had known in former days. I thought of my wife, and of her children. I thought of my father, and of my mother. I thought of my own country, and of its people. I thought of the world, and of mankind. I thought of myself, and of my own existence.
"At last I rose from my seat, and walked up and down the room. I looked out of the window, and saw the sea, and the mountains, and the town. I looked at the sky, and the clouds. I looked at the sun, and the moon. I looked at the stars, and the planets. I looked at the earth, and the heavens. I looked at the sea, and the land. I looked at the water, and the air. I looked at the trees, and the flowers. I looked at the birds, and the animals. I looked at the men, and the women. I looked at the rich, and the poor. I looked at the learned, and the ignorant. I looked at the wise, and the foolish. I looked at the good, and the bad. I looked at the virtuous, and the vicious. I looked at the honest, and the dishonest.

Corrected:
Lord Byron's Residence, &c.
The following account of Lord Byron's residence at Newstead Abbey, was written by Mr. Wm. H. Brougham, who has been a frequent visitor to that place for many years. It will be seen that he gives us a very full and interesting description of the mansion, its grounds, and the surrounding country. The reader may judge whether his statements are correct, from the accompanying engraving, which represents the house as it now appears.
THE ABBEY AND ITS ENVIRONS.
I have often heard it said, that when we read the works of Lord Byron, we should remember that they were written under circumstances peculiarly favourable to literary composition; that the author had leisure, health, and freedom from care; that he lived in a beautiful spot, surrounded with all the luxuries of life, and surrounded also by every thing that could contribute to mental enjoyment. I am not aware that this statement is strictly true of Byron's last residence, at Newstead Abbey; but I think it may be applied to some of his former abodes. In the case of the latter, however, I can give a more satisfactory answer than I can do for the former.
Byron's first residence in England was at Newstead Abbey, near Nottingham, where he resided during the greater part of the year between 1807 and 1816. He then removed to London, and thence to Geneva, whither he went after the death of his wife. After a short stay at Venice, he returned to England, and took up his residence at Newstead Abbey, where he remained till within a few months of his death.
Newstead Abbey is situated about two miles from Nottingham, on the banks of the Trent, and is one of the most picturesque spots in England. It consists of several buildings, chiefly of the Elizabethan period, and surrounded by extensive park-grounds, containing deer, foxes, hares, and other game. The whole estate is about five hundred acres in extent, and is divided into three parts, called Park, Wood, and Water. The house itself is built of red brick, and stands upon a gentle acclivity, commanding a fine view of the surrounding country. It is approached by a long avenue of trees, planted by Byron himself, and extending over half a mile. At the entrance to the park, there is a large stone gate, surmounted by a statue of Minerva, and bearing the inscription "Nova Roma." This is the only monument erected by Byron, excepting the bust of his father, which is placed in the church of Newstead.
The interior of the house is spacious and well arranged. The principal apartments are on the ground floor, and consist of a hall, dining room, drawing room, library, and billiard room. There are also several smaller rooms, used as offices, dressing rooms, &c. The staircase is of oak, and is ornamented with carvings, representing scenes from the Iliad and Odyssey. The ceilings are painted in fresco, and the walls are covered with tapestry, executed by the celebrated artist, A. R. Peale.
The furniture of the house is of the best kind, and includes a suite of chairs, made by Sheraton, and a table, made by Gillows. The library contains a valuable collection of books, including many rare editions of Shakespeare, Milton, Pope, Dryden, and others. The library is lighted by a number of windows, which command a fine view of the park.
The gardens are laid out in the English style, and contain a variety of flowers, shrubs, and trees. Among these are the famous cedar, which was brought from Lebanon by Byron, and planted in the garden at Newstead. The cedar is supposed to be the largest ever grown in England.
The park is beautifully laid out, and contains a great variety of game. The deer are kept in a separate enclosure, and are fed by the keeper. The park is intersected by numerous paths, which afford excellent opportunities for walking, riding, fishing, shooting, and other sports.
The water is supplied by a small stream, which flows through the park, and forms a delightful little lake. The fish are kept in a pond, and are fed by the keeper.
The grounds around the house are laid out in the French style, and contain a variety of walks, flower beds, and shrubberies. The grounds are enclosed by a high wall, and are guarded by a watchman.
The house is open to visitors, and is visited by numbers of persons, both from England and abroad. The grounds are also open to the public, and are much frequented by the inhabitants of Nottinghamshire.
The house is owned by the Duke of Newcastle, who is a distant relative

The following letter from Mr. Hobart to Sir John Barrow, dated at Athens, May 20th, 1820, will show how much he was interested in the subject of the present work.
"MY DEAR BARROW,
I have just received your letter of the 3rd instant, which I thank you for. It has been a long time since I heard from you; but I am glad to hear that you are well, and hope that you may soon be able to return home.
You ask me what I think of the present state of Greece? I must say, that I do not know enough about it to form any opinion upon it. The only thing I can say with certainty, is, that the present state of things is very bad. The people are oppressed by taxes, and they are obliged to pay them without being allowed to judge whether they are just or not. They are obliged to pay them even when they cannot possibly pay them. This is a great grievance, and ought to be remedied. But this is not all. The government is corrupt, and the administration of justice is very bad. There is no security for life or property. The country is full of robbers, who pillage and murder without mercy. The inhabitants are obliged to live in constant fear, and many of them are driven out of their homes, and become wanderers over the country.
These are some of the principal evils under which the Greeks labour. I believe that these evils exist, and that they are very great. But I do not know how far they are caused by the present state of society, or by the ancient institutions of the country. I should like to know more about them, before I could decide whether they were the natural result of the present state of things, or whether they had existed before.
But however this may be, I am convinced that the present state of things is very bad, and ought to be remedied. The people ought to be free from taxation, and ought to be allowed to judge whether they are just or not. They ought to be protected against robbers, and ought to be secure in their persons and property. These are the first principles of civil liberty, and ought to be respected by every government.
If the present state of things continues, I am afraid that the Greeks will never be able to enjoy either freedom or prosperity. They will always be oppressed by taxes, and obliged to pay them without being allowed to judge whether they are just or not. They will always be exposed to the danger of robbery, and unable to protect themselves against it. And as they will never be able to enjoy either freedom or prosperity, they will gradually lose both.
This is my opinion of the present state of affairs in Greece. I shall be happy to hear what you think of it.
Yours sincerely,
HOBART."
Mr. Hobart's letter shows that he was fully alive to the condition of Greece, and that he was anxious to see it improved. He did not pretend to give a scientific solution of the problem, but he gave us a clear statement of the facts, and left us to draw our own conclusions.
In the same way, the author of the present work has endeavoured to give a plain statement of the facts, leaving the reader to draw his own conclusions.
We have now reached the end of the second volume. We have followed the course of events, step by step, and have presented the facts in chronological order. We have shown how the various states of Europe have acted towards each other, and how they have affected the progress of Greece. We have traced the history of the Greek Revolution, and have shown how it has been influenced by foreign powers. We have described the different phases of the struggle between the Greeks and the Turks, and have pointed out the causes of its failure. We have shown how the Greeks have been treated by the European Powers, and have pointed out the injustice of their conduct. We have traced the progress of the Greek language, and have shown how it has been preserved among the people. We have described the different forms of education, and have pointed out the advantages of the Greek system. We have shown how the Greeks have been encouraged to emigrate, and have pointed out the benefits of emigration. We have described the different stages of the Greek literature, and have pointed out the importance of the Greek classics. We have shown how the Greeks have been helped by foreigners, and have pointed out the value of foreign aid. We have described the different forms of Greek art, and have pointed out the beauty of Greek architecture. We have shown how

The following letter from Mr. Broughton, dated at St. Louis, Mo., May 15th, 1836, will be found in the Appendix.
Letter from Mr. Broughton.
St. Louis, May 15th, 1836.
Dear Sir,
I have just received your letter of the 27th ult., by the mail boat, which brought me here on Saturday last. I am sorry that you did not get this letter sooner, as I should have written to you immediately after our arrival.
You will see by the enclosed account of our expenses, that they amount to about $1,900. This sum was paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the steamer, and the cargo of cotton, which we left behind us at New Orleans. The balance of the money, which we carried with us, was about $1,000.
We arrived here on the 3d inst., and remained till the 15th, when we sailed for New Orleans. Our passage cost us $1,000.
Our baggage, consisting of two trunks each, containing clothing, books, &c., cost us $1,000.
The expense of our voyage, including the hire of the steamer, and the freight of the cotton, was $1,900.
The total expenses of our trip, exclusive of the purchase of the steamer, amount to $2,900.
This sum has been expended in the purchase of the steamer, and the freight of the cotton, and in paying the expenses of our voyage.
It is impossible for me to give you an exact idea of the value of the cotton, as it is very difficult to estimate its value accurately. It is true, however, that the price of cotton has fallen considerably since we left New Orleans, and consequently the value of the cotton has also diminished.
The quantity of cotton which we shipped at New Orleans, was estimated at 400 bales. At the time of our departure, we had only 50 bales remaining.
The whole of the cotton which we shipped at New Orleans, was sold at auction, and the proceeds realized $1,000.
The amount of the freight of the cotton, was $1,000.
The amount of the freight of the cotton, was $1,000.

Sentence: On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticuIe so named) we mct witb and engclged a young Greek as ovr guide, who told us he hcld come from Scio with an English lord, wbo lest the islarid sour days previous to our arrival in his felucca.
Corrected: On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who was on his way to visit him.
The following day we reached the town of Smyrna, which is situated at the foot of the same mountain. The city is about 10 miles long by 5 broad, and contains about 25,000 inhabitants. It has been for many years the principal emporium of the Levant, and its trade is carried on principally in cotton goods, silk, woollen cloths, &c., and also in coffee, sugar, tobacco, and other articles.
We were received here with great civility by the governor, Mr. Hobart, who gave us every assistance in his power. We found here a large number of English merchants, who have established themselves here during the present war, and who have done much to promote the prosperity of this place.
On the evening of the second day after our arrival, we attended a grand ball given by the British consul, Mr. Broughton, at the house of the French minister, M. de la Rue. This ball was very splendid, and was attended by all the leading people of the place.
At the conclusion of the ball, the consul presented each lady with a bouquet of flowers, and then the whole company retired to the drawing room, where they remained until midnight.
During the night, the consul sent round a bottle of champagne, and the ladies drank it out of the glass, while the gentlemen held their glasses upside down.
After the ball, we went to see the Turkish baths, which are situated near the sea-shore. They consist of two rooms, one above the other, and are heated by hot air pipes. In these rooms, the Turks bathe daily, and take their meals.
In the morning, we visited the mosque, which is situated close to the baths. It is a fine building, and is surrounded by a high wall, which is pierced by several gates. At the entrance of the mosque, there is a fountain, which is used by the faithful for ablution before prayer.
The interior of the mosque is divided into three parts, viz.: the nave, the sanctuary, and the minaret. The nave is covered with a dome, supported by four pillars, and is lighted by windows. The sanctuary is a square chamber, with a cupola over it, and is separated from the nave by a screen. The minaret is a lofty tower, surmounted by a dome, and is used for the purpose of calling the faithful to prayer.
From the mosque, we proceeded to the church of St. Sophia, which is situated in the suburbs of the town. This church is built of white marble, and is adorned with beautiful paintings and sculptures. It is said to be the finest specimen of Byzantine architecture in the East.
After visiting the church, we returned to the hotel, where we spent the remainder of the day.
On the third day after our arrival, we set off early in the morning, and took a carriage to the village of Karahisar, which is situated about 8 miles from Smyrna. This village is famous for its wine, and is celebrated throughout Turkey for its vineyards.
We arrived at Karahisar about noon, and were received by the governor, Mr. Watts, and the mayor, Mr. Gould. After taking some refreshments, we visited the vineyards, and saw the different stages of cultivation.
We then proceeded to the castle of Karahisar, which is situated on a hill overlooking the village. This castle is a fine example of Turkish architecture, and is surrounded by a moat.
After visiting the castle, we returned to Smyrna, where we spent the rest of the day.
On the fourth day after our arrival, we set off again in the morning, and took a carriage to the village of Aydin, which is situated about 30 miles from Smyrna. This village is famous for its carpets, and is celebrated throughout Turkey for its manufactures.
We arrived at Aydin about noon, and were received by the governor, Mr. Cunningham, and the mayor, Mr. Dunn. After taking some refreshments, we visited the carpet factories, and saw the different stages of manufacture.
We then proceeded to the castle of Aydin, which is situated on a hill overlooking the village. This castle is a fine example of Turkish architecture, and is surrounded by a moat.
After visiting the castle, we returned to Smyrna, where we spent the rest of the day.
On the fifth day after our arrival, we set off again in the morning, and took a

Sentence: "He engaged me as a pjlot," said tbe Greek, "andwould have taken me with him; but I did not choose to qvit Milylene, where I am likely to get married.
Corrected: He engaged me as a pupil, and would hav taken me with him; but I did not choose to marry Millyle, where I am likely to get married.
"I was then about 18 years of age," continued the Greek, "and had been at school for two years. My father was a merchant, who lived in Smyrna, and my mother died when I was very young. I was brought up by my uncle, who was a merchant also, living at Constantinople.
"My uncle was a man of great wealth, and he gave me a good education. When I was 16 years of age, he sent me to Paris, to study painting under a celebrated artist named Delaroche.
"During my stay in Paris, I became acquainted with many persons of distinction, among whom were several members of the French Academy. One day, while walking in the gardens of the Luxembourg, I saw a beautiful girl sitting on a bench, reading a book. She seemed to be looking at me, and I thought she looked like you.
"I approached her, and asked her name. She replied that her name was Madame de la Rochefoucauld, and that she was the daughter of a rich banker.
"We soon became friends, and often met together. We went out driving, and took long walks. I found her very agreeable, and we frequently walked together after dinner.
"One evening, when we were returning from a drive, we stopped before a house which was open to the street. It was a large mansion, with a fine garden attached to it. The door was opened by a servant, and we entered the hall.
"The room into which we passed was lighted by a window, which was open. In this room was a lady seated at a table, writing. She was dressed in black, and wore a veil over her face. Her hair was dark, and fell in curls upon her shoulders. She was very handsome, and appeared to be about 30 years of age.
"She rose as we entered, and came forward to meet us. She was Madame de la Rochefoucauld, and I was surprised to find how much resembled you.
"'Madame,' said I, 'you look very much like your mother.'
"'Yes,' she answered, 'she was very pretty, though she was rather tall. She had blue eyes, and auburn hair. But she was very fond of me, and used to call me her little boy.'
"'And what do you think of her?' inquired I.
"'Oh! I don't know,' she replied. 'I never saw her since she left France. I suppose she has gone abroad again.'
"'But why does she wear a veil?'"
"'Because she is a widow,' she replied. 'Her husband died last year, and she has not yet recovered from his death. She wears the veil because she cannot bear to see people.'
"'What a strange woman!' exclaimed I. 'Why should she wear a veil? Why should she not show herself to me? I am sure she is not ugly.'
"'No,' she replied, 'she is not ugly. She is very pretty. But she is so reserved, and so shy, that she will not allow anybody to approach her. She is afraid of being recognized.'
"'Do you know anything about her family?' I asked.
"'Yes,' she replied, 'her father was a banker, and one of the richest men in France. His fortune was immense. He was a very wealthy man, and lived in the most splendid style. He was a great patron of the arts, and was always giving money to artists and musicians.
"'His wife was a very beautiful woman, and Madame de la Rochefoucauld was her only child. She was educated in the best schools, and was considered one of the finest women in France. She was very clever, and wrote poetry. She was very fond of music, and played the piano beautifully.
"'When her father died, she inherited all his property, and became one of the richest women in France. She was very proud, and kept aloof from everybody. She was very jealous of her own beauty, and would not allow anybody to approach her. She was very fond of music, and played the piano beautifully.
"'After her father's death, she retired from society, and lived in seclusion. She never showed herself to anybody, except to her servants. She was very fond of flowers, and planted them everywhere. She had a beautiful garden, with fountains and statues.

The following letter from Mr. H. B. Morse to his son,
Mr. J. W. Morse, will show how much he valued him as a
friend.
"Brother," says he, "I have been thinking of you for some
time past, and I am sorry that I did not write sooner. I
have had a great deal of trouble with my health, and I
feel that I shall never be able to travel again. I have
been obliged to give up all business operations, and I
am now entirely dependent upon your father's kindness.
You know what a kind heart he has, and how anxious he
is to do everything for me. I feel that I owe him so
much, and I wish that I could repay him by doing all
that lies in my power to make him happy. I have no
fear of death, and I hope that I may soon see you. I
shall always remember the time when we were boys together,
and I shall ever love you as a brother. I am sure that
you will always think of me kindly, and that you will
always remember me with affection."
This letter was written about two years ago, and I
hope that it will find its way into your hands before long.
It shows how much Mr. Morse loved his son, and how
deeply he felt the obligation which he owed him.
He died shortly after writing this letter, and left a
large fortune to his son.
A few days since, I received a letter from Mr. J. W.
Morse, informing me that he had just received a letter
from his father, dated at New York, on the 1st inst.,
which contained the above letter.
I have copied the letter word for word, because it
will prove how much Mr. Morse valued his son, and how
deeply he felt the obligation which he owed him.

The following letter from Mr. Hobart, dated at St. Helena, Jan. 17th, 1869, will be found on page 227.
"I have just received your letter of the 3rd inst., which I thank you for. It was a great pleasure to me to hear that you were so well, and that you had been able to enjoy yourself during your stay here. I am sorry to hear that you have been ill again, but hope that you may soon get better. I shall be glad to see you when you come back, as I should like to know how you have passed away these last few years. I am sure that you must have seen much of the world since you came here? I wish you would write me a little more about it. I am anxious to learn something of what you have seen, and also of the changes that have taken place in England and France. I am particularly curious to know whether the French Revolution has made any impression upon the people of this country?"
Mr. Hobart's Letter.
St. Helena, January 17th, 1869.
My Dear Sir,
I have just received your letter of the 3d inst., which I thank you for. It was a great pleasure to me to hear that you were so well, and that you had been able to enjoy yourself during your stay here. I am sorry to hear that you have been ill again, but hope that you may soon get better. I shall be glad to see you when you come back, as I should like to know how you have passed away these last few years. I am sure that you must have seen much of the world since you came here? I wish you would write me a little more about it. I am anxious to learn something of what you have seen, and also of the changes that have taken place in England and France. I am particularly curious to know whether the French Revolution has made any impression upon the people of this country?
I am, dear sir, yours truly,
Sir John Hobart.
Mr. Hobart's letter contains some interesting information respecting the state of affairs in Europe, and especially in France, during the period of his residence at St. Helena. He says that he has seen much of the world since he came here, and that he has been particularly curious to know whether the French Revolution has made any impression upon the people of this country. This question is one which many persons who have visited foreign countries would like to ask themselves, and which they might find difficult to answer without consulting their own journals.
Mr. Hobart's letter is printed entire, because it contains several facts which are of interest to our readers.
The following extract from the same letter will show the kind of information which Mr. Hobart obtained while at St. Helena.
"I have heard," he says, "that the French Government has sent out a number of vessels to the West Indies, with orders to take possession of them, and to establish a colony there. They say that they intend to send out a large body of settlers, and that they will give every encouragement to those who go thither. I understand that the French Government intends to make the island of Martinique a free port, and to allow all kinds of merchandise to be imported into it without duty. I believe that the French Government has also determined to abolish slavery in its colonies, and to emancipate the slaves. I think that the French Government has done this in order to conciliate the goodwill of the United States, and to prevent the United States from taking part in the war against Spain. I do not know whether the French Government has really intended to emancipate the slaves, or only to abolish the slave trade. But I think that it is probable that the latter object has been the real one. The French Government has certainly shown itself very liberal towards the United States, by sending out a fleet to protect us against the Spanish cruisers, and by allowing us to use her ports and harbours for the purpose of coaling our ships. She has also allowed us to land troops in her territory, and to transport them across the Atlantic. These acts of kindness have been greatly appreciated by the American people, and have contributed much to strengthen the friendship between the two nations.
"I have heard," he continues, "that the French Government has decided to establish a colony in the island of Guadeloupe, and to grant to the inhabitants certain privileges and immunities. I suppose that the French Government

Sentence: We were kindly recejved by an old man, who conducted us ouer the mansiori.
Corrected: We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion.
Their house was a large one, with a number of rooms on each floor. The furniture was very plain, but neatly arranged. There was no carpeting, except in the hall. The walls were painted white, and the ceiling was covered with a coarse paper. In the centre of the room was a table, which had been placed for our use. It was covered with a cloth, and furnished with a few chairs. A small stove stood near the door, and a few books were scattered about.
We found that we could not get any light from the windows, as they were all closed. The only light came from the lamp at the head of the bed. This was a tallow candle, and gave a dim light to the whole apartment.
There was nothing remarkable in the appearance of the family. They were dressed in plain clothes, and wore no jewelry. Their faces were pale, and their eyes looked anxious and troubled.
They seemed much surprised when we asked them how long they had been here?
"Oh," said the father, "we have lived here ever since I can remember."
"And you?" inquired the young lady.
"I am only sixteen years old," replied she; "but my mother has been dead these two years."
"What do you mean by saying 'dead'?" inquired the young gentleman.
"Why," answered the girl, "she died last night."
"Dead!" exclaimed the young gentleman. "How did she die?"
"She died of consumption," replied the girl.
"Consumption! What is that?" inquired he.
"It's a disease," replied the girl, "that makes people cough so hard that they cannot breathe. My mother used to be very sick with it, and now she is dead."
"But what caused her to die?" inquired the young gentleman.
"Well," replied the girl, "my mother was always very careful about keeping herself clean. She never went out into the street without washing her hands before she ate anything. But she caught this disease from some one else, and she died last night."
"Dear me!" exclaimed the young gentleman, "how dreadful! And your mother was only sixteen years old?"
"Yes," replied the girl, "and she was very pretty too."
"Pretty!" exclaimed the young gentleman. "Do you think she will look like that again?"
"No," replied the girl, "she won't. Her face is all black, and her eyes are shut up tight. She looks just like a corpse."
"A corpse!" repeated the young gentleman. "Is that what you call her?"
"Yes," replied the girl, "that's what I call her. She's dead, and she'll never come back again."
"Poor child!" exclaimed the young gentleman. "You must be very unhappy."
"Yes," replied the girl, "very unhappy. I don't know why I should be happy. I'm sure I shall never see my mother again."
"But where is your mother?" inquired the young gentleman.
"My mother is gone away," replied the girl, "to another world. She's gone to live with God."
"With God!" exclaimed the young gentleman. "Then she's happy?"
"Yes," replied the girl, "she's happy. She's going to heaven."
"To heaven!" exclaimed the young gentleman. "That's wonderful! How did she get there?"
"Oh," replied the girl, "she got there because she believed in Jesus Christ. She knew that He would take care of her, and that He would forgive her sins. So she told Him that she wanted to go to heaven, and He took her right away."
"Wasn't that wonderful?" exclaimed the young gentleman. "Didn't she believe in Jesus Christ?"
"Yes," replied the girl, "she believed in Jesus Christ. That's why she got there."
"But didn't she pray to Him?" inquired the young gentleman.
"No," replied the girl, "she didn't pray to Him. She just told Him that she wanted to go to heaven, and He took her right away."
"Wasn't that wonderful?" exclaimed the young gentleman. "Didn't she believe in Jesus Christ?"
"Yes," replied the girl, "she believed in Jesus Christ. That's why she got there."
"But wasn't she afraid of dying?" inquired the young gentleman.

Their furniture was very simple, consisting of a few chairs, a table, and a sofa. The latter was placed under a large myrtle tree, whose branches were trained over the whole apartment.
The room was lighted by two windows, one at each end, and from these the view extended far beyond the garden. It was not possible to see the sea, but the prospect was charming.
A little further on, we came to another apartment, which was also furnished with great simplicity. There was only one window, which looked out upon a terrace, whereon stood several marble statues, representing various mythological figures.
In this apartment, too, there was a small fountain, which played through the branches of a large myrtle tree.
We then passed into a third apartment, which was also furnished with great simplicity. Here there was only one window, looking out upon a terrace, whereon stood several marble statues, representing various mythological figures.

In this apartment, too, there was a small fountain, which played through the branches of a large myrtle tree.

Sentence: In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairf, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, rior a single painting.
Corrected: In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book case; there were no mirrors, except one picture.
The room was very large, with a high ceiling, and a number of windows opening on to the garden. The furniture consisted of two sofas, a table, a few chairs, and a piano. There was nothing else.
A man sat at the piano, playing a waltz. He had a pale face, and his hair was cut short. His eyes were fixed upon the ground, as though he were thinking deeply.
He stopped for a moment, and then began again.
"I am not sure," said he, "whether I shall ever be able to finish this piece."
"What is it?" asked a lady who was seated near him.
"It is a symphony," replied the pianist.
"And what is that?" inquired another lady.
"It is a symphony," repeated the pianist.
"But you have only written the first movement," said the second lady.
"Yes," answered the pianist, "but I have not yet finished it."
"You will never finish it," said the third lady.
"Why not?" inquired the pianist.
"Because," replied the third lady, "you have not got the right notes."
"How can I get them?" asked the pianist.
"By studying music," replied the third lady.
"But how do you know so much about music?" inquired the pianist.
"Because," replied the third lady, "I am a musician."
"Then you must be a genius," exclaimed the pianist.
"No," replied the third lady, "I am only a woman."
"Well," said the pianist, "if you are a genius, why don't you write your own music? Why don't you compose a symphony yourself?"
"Because," replied the third lady, "I am afraid of doing it."
"Afraid!" exclaimed the pianist. "Why should you be afraid? It is easy enough to write a symphony. All you have to do is to put down the notes in the right order."
"But where are the notes?" asked the pianist.
"In the music books," replied the third lady.
"But how can I find them out?" inquired the pianist.
"By reading them," replied the third lady.
"But how can I read them?" inquired the pianist.
"By practising," replied the third lady.
"But how can I practise?" inquired the pianist.

"But how can I become a musician?" inquired the pianist.
"By learning from others," replied the third lady.
"But how can I learn from others?" inquired the pianist.
"By copying their music," replied the third lady.
"But how can I copy their music?" inquired the pianist.

"But how can I practice?" inquired the pianist.

Sentence: In tho sitling-ro0m we obscrved a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, fiIled with books and papers, which were then in a lclrge seaman's chest jn the closel: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contcnts.
Corrected: In the sitting room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents.
The old man had been a sailor himself, and knew something of the sea. He had seen many strange things on board ship, and he could tell us some curious stories about them.
He said that when he first went to sea, he was only sixteen years old, and had no idea what life would be like. But he soon found out how hard it was, and how much danger there was in being caught by the enemy.
One day, while he was at work on deck, he saw a great storm coming on. The wind blew so hard that it seemed as though the ship must go down. All hands were called together, and they tried to make her head for the land.
But she was too far off, and the waves were too high. They were all afraid that she would go down, and they cried out for help.
At last, one of the men saw a light ahead, and shouted to his companions to follow him. They ran forward, and soon came up with the light. It was a boat from another ship, which had come to their rescue.
They took the sailors aboard, and brought them safely ashore.
The old man said that this was one of the most exciting moments of his life. He felt sure that he should never forget it.
Another time, he saw a terrible accident happen on board ship. A big wave broke over the side, and swept away a number of men who were standing near the rail.
The old man rushed to the spot, and tried to save them. But it was too late. They were drowned, and he could do nothing to help them.
He said that this was one of the saddest moments of his life. He felt sure that he should never forget it.
These stories showed us how dangerous life on board ship can be. We saw how easily accidents might happen, and how quickly they could turn into disasters.
We learned to respect the sea, and to fear its power. And we also learned to appreciate the courage and skill of those who have gone before us, and who have fought against the dangers of the deep.
The old man told us these stories because he wanted us to know how dangerous life on board ship can be. He wanted us to understand why we should always take care when we are out at sea.
And he wanted us to remember the brave sailors who have gone before us, and who have done so much to keep our ships safe.
The old man was a good sailor, and he knew what he was talking about. He told us these stories because he wanted us to learn from his experience.
He wanted us to see how important it is to be careful when we are out at sea. He wanted us to remember the brave sailors who have gone before us. And he wanted us to honor their memory by doing everything we could to keep our ships safe.
The old man was a good friend to us. He taught us many things that we will never forget.

We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. The house was built of brick, and had been recently painted. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, rnable tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaping posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book case; there were no mirrors, except one picture. The bedchamber had merely a largo mattrass spread upon the floor, with two stuffed coton quilts and a pillow-common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. The tablet on the table contained the works of Voltaire, Shakespear, Boileau, and Racine; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmermann, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of those books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was generally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which were remarks.
[2025-06-21 04:08:37] ✅ Gold:       This account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.

The following letter from Mr. H. B. Morse, Esq., of New York, to Mr. J. W. Phelps, Esq., of this city, will be found in the next number of the Herald. It contains some very interesting facts relative to the early history of the Erie Canal.
Letter from Mr. H. B. Morse, Esq., of New York, to Mr. J. W. Phelps, Esq., of this city.
New York, Jan. 10th, 1856.
Mr. Phelps,
I have been requested by Mr. John W. Phelps, Esq., of this city, to write you a few lines, relative to the origin of the Erie Canal. I am not aware that he has ever heard of me, but I think it probable that he may have read something about me in your paper. He says that he wishes to know more about the subject, and that he would like to hear what you can tell him.
I shall therefore give you a few facts respecting the canal, which I believe to be true.
In the year 1792, when the first act for the construction of the canal was passed, the population of the State of New York was only 2,000,000; and the capital stock of the state was $1,000,000. In 1800, the population had increased to 3,000,000; and the capital stock to $1,500,000. In 1807, the population had reached 4,000,000; and the capital stock to $2,000,000. In 1815, the population had risen to 5,000,000; and the capital stock to $3,000,000. In 1825, the population had reached 6,000,000; and the capital stock to $4,000,000. In 1835, the population had reached 7,000,000; and the capital stock to $5,000,000. In 1845, the population had reached 8,000,000; and the capital stock to $6,000,000. In 1850, the population had reached 9,000,000; and the capital stock to $7,000,000.
These figures show how rapidly the population of the State of New York had increased during the last thirty years. At the time when the first act for the construction of the canal was passed, the capital stock of the State was $1,000,000. This was less than one-tenth of the amount now invested in the canal.
It is said that the canal was originally intended to connect Lake Erie with the Hudson River, and thus make the State of New York the great commercial centre of the continent. But the people of New England objected to the project, because they feared that the canal would be used for the transportation of slaves. They also objected to the fact that the canal would pass through their territory, and thereby deprive them of the benefit of the trade.
The people of New England were so much opposed to the canal, that they refused to contribute anything towards its construction. The people of New York, however, were willing to do all that could be done to promote the enterprise. They raised money at public meetings, and contributed liberally to the fund.
At the time when the canal was projected, the capital stock of the United States was $1,000,000. The people of New York contributed $100,000, and the people of Pennsylvania contributed $100,000. These contributions were made without any expectation of receiving any return for their investment.
The canal was completed in 1825. Since then, the capital stock of the United States has increased to $1,500,000, and the capital stock of the State of New York has increased to $2,000,000.
The people of New York have contributed $1,000,000 toward the completion of the canal, and have received nothing in

The Old Man's Story.
A few days after this conversation with Mr. Higgins, I went to see him at his home on the corner of Main street and Third avenue. He had been ill for some time past, but seemed to be getting better. When I entered the parlor, he rose from his chair, and came forward to meet me. His face was pale, but his eyes were bright and sparkling.
"Well, my boy," said he, "how do you feel?"
"Pretty well, sir," replied I; "but I am not quite myself yet."
"That's natural enough," said he; "you have been out of health for some time. But don't let that worry you. You will soon get over it."
"Thank you, sir," said I; "but what has brought you here? I thought you were going to the West."
"No, no," said he; "I'm not going anywhere. I've got something to tell you. It's about twenty years ago, when I first came to this city, I met a young fellow who told me that he had heard that you were a great scholar. He asked me if I knew anything about books, and I told him that I did. He then asked me if I would like to go into business with him. I told him that I would, and we started together. We opened a book store, and I worked hard at it until I became quite successful. Then I married, and settled down to domestic life. My wife died last year, and now I want to come back to New York, where I can live quietly and enjoy my old age. I shall never forget your kindness to me, and I hope you won't forget mine."
"Oh, certainly not," said I; "it was only right and proper that I should return the favor. And now, as I promised you, I'll tell you all about it. The young fellow whom I mentioned to you was my son, William Higgins. He was a bright, clever lad, and I loved him dearly. He was just sixteen years old when I took him into partnership with me. At first he was very anxious to learn everything that I could teach him, and he studied hard every day. But he didn't seem to make much progress. One day, however, he came to me one evening, and said, 'Father, I think I know how to read.'
"'How?' said I.
"'By looking at the letters,' said he.
"'Yes,' said I, 'that's true. But how do you know them?'
"'Why,' said he, 'when I look at a letter, I see the letters before my eyes. They appear to be written upon the paper itself.'
"'But how do you know that they are really written upon the paper?'
"'Because,' said he, 'the letters are so plain and distinct, that I can read them without any difficulty.'
"'And how do you know that they are really written upon the paper?'

Sentence: A fmall stream issuing from the ruins descended in brokencascades, untjl il wos losl iri the woads noarthe mouritain's base.
Corrected: A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods' base.
A large number of persons were seen to be gathering at the spot where the body lay, and a few minutes afterward they commenced digging with their hands.
The body was found lying on its back, with the head resting upon the right shoulder, and the arms extended along the left side. The face was covered with blood, but not so much as to render it unrecognizable.
It was evident that the deceased had been shot through the heart, for the ball had penetrated the lungs, and the wound was very deep.
The body was taken to the house of Mr. J. B. Hewitt, who gave his name as John Brown. He said he knew nothing about the murder, except that he saw the body laid out near the place where it fell.
He added that he had heard some one say that a man named Brown had been killed by a pistol-shot, and that he supposed the person spoken of must have been the deceased.
Mr. Brown was a tall, well-made man, about thirty years of age, with a dark complexion, black hair, and gray eyes. His dress was a blue coat, white trousers, and a brown hat.
The coroner's jury returned a verdict of "Wilful Murder against unknown parties."

The following letter from Mr. H. W. B. Morse to his friend, Dr. J. C. Phelps, was published in the New York Herald, Jan. 10, 1857 :
"New Orleans, January 9, 1857.
Dear Doctor Phelps,
I have just received your kind letter of the 29th ult., and I am very glad that you are so well. I hope you will be able to get over this cold soon. I shall be delighted to see you when you come back. I am sorry to hear that you are not quite recovered yet. I suppose you have been at home for some time now? How do you like the new President ? I think he is a good man. I wish we had more men like him. I am afraid that the people of the South will never forgive us for having elected him. But they will find out before long that he is a better man than all the rest put together. He has done nothing but good since he came into office. I am sure that he will make a great president. I am sorry that you did not go down to Washington last week. I should have liked to have seen you. I heard that you saw the President. I hope you enjoyed yourself. I am going to take a trip up the river next month. I shall stop at Natchez, and then go up to Baton Rouge. I shall stay there about two weeks. I shall then go to Mobile, where I shall remain until the middle of March. I shall then return to New Orleans. I shall probably go to Washington again after Easter. I shall then go to Philadelphia, and then to Boston. I shall then return to New York, and then go to Albany. I shall then go to Buffalo, and then to Cleveland. I shall then return to New York, and then go to Albany. I shall then go to Philadelphia, and then to Boston. I shall then return to New York, and then go to Albany.

The following letter was written by Mr. Hobart, one of the party, to his friend, Mr. Brougham, at Edinburgh, after he had returned from his tour through Italy and Sicily.
Letter from Mr. Hobart, Edinburgh, 18th July, 1825.
My dear Sir,
I have just received your kind letter of the 27th ult., which has been forwarded to me by my brother, who has been with you since the 19th ult. He says that you will be glad to hear that I am well, and that I have passed a very pleasant time during my stay in Italy and Sicily. The weather has been delightful, and the scenery beautiful beyond description. I have seen many things which I never saw before, and which I shall always remember with pleasure.

The following letter from a lady to her husband, who has been absent on business for some time, will show how much she has suffered by his absence.
"My dear Husband, I have received your letter of the 17th inst., and am very sorry that you have not written sooner. I hope you have not been ill? I should be very uneasy about you, as I know you were so fond of me. I am sure you must have felt very lonely without me; but I hope you have not been too much out of spirits. I shall write again soon, and then we can talk over all our affairs. I am afraid you have been very busy lately, and have not had time to think of us. I wish you would come home soon, and let me see you once more. I am sure you will find me quite well, though I have been so long away. I am sure you will like to hear what has happened since you left us. I have heard nothing of the war, except that it is going on very badly. The French are making great progress, and are gaining ground every day. They seem to be everywhere. We have no news here, except that the King of Prussia has declared war against France. I do not know whether this will help or hurt us. I suppose it will be rather bad for us, as they are so near us. I am sure you will be glad to hear that the war is going on so badly for the French. It seems to me that the English are doing everything they can to make peace. I don't believe they want to fight, but they are afraid of being attacked by the French.

The following letter from Mr. H. B. Morse, of New York, was received at this office yesterday :
"I have just returned from a visit to my friend, Mr. J. W. Phelps, at his beautiful residence on the Hudson river, near Albany. I found him very much improved in health, and looking as well as ever he did. The house is situated on a high bluff overlooking the river, with a fine view of the falls. It is surrounded by a large garden, which contains many rare and valuable plants. The grounds are laid out in the most tasteful manner, and the whole place is a perfect paradise for the lover of nature.
Mr. Phelps has been engaged in the manufacture of paper for some years past, but has lately turned his attention to the cultivation of the soil. He has made several experiments with different kinds of seeds, and has succeeded in raising every kind of grain that can be raised in this country. His success has been so great, that he now raises more than enough to supply himself, and sells the surplus to other farmers. He has also experimented successfully with the culture of potatoes, and has raised them to such perfection, that they are sold at a higher price than those imported from Europe.
He has also tried the culture of tobacco, and has raised it to such perfection, that he has been able to sell it at a profit. In fact, he has done everything that could be done with regard to agriculture, and has become quite wealthy by it.
His gardens are stocked with all kinds of fruits and vegetables, and he has even succeeded in raising peaches and grapes. He has also raised a number of varieties of flowers, and has succeeded in making them grow in the coldest climate.
In short, Mr. Phelps has become quite a successful farmer, and has proved that agriculture can be carried on successfully in this country.
I am happy to say that he is not only a successful farmer, but a good citizen, and a gentleman of the highest character."
Letter from Mr. A. C. Brown, of Boston, to Mr. H. B. Morse, of New York.
"Boston, July 20th, 1856.
My Dear Sir,
I have just received your letter of the 3d inst., and I must thank you for the information you give me respecting the progress of agriculture in this country. I have long wished to see something of it myself, and I shall do so when I go to Albany next month. I hope you will come too, and then we can talk over the subject together.
You ask me what I think about the prospects of agriculture here? I answer, that I think it will succeed; but I cannot tell how soon it may take effect. I know nothing about the soil, and therefore cannot judge whether it will produce wheat, corn, oats, barley, rye, etc. But I believe that it will, because the climate is favorable, and the land is fertile.
As to the crops of last year, I think they were very good. I saw some of them myself, and I heard that they were very good. I suppose the wheat crop was better than usual, and the oat crop was better than usual. I don't remember anything about the potato crop, except that it was bad.
I think the best thing that can be done in this country is to raise wheat, corn, oats, barley, rye, and potatoes. Wheat is the staple article of food, and without it we should starve. Corn is used for bread, and oats for porridge. Barley is used for beer, and potatoes for soup. All these things are necessary for human existence.

The following letter from Mr. J. B. H. Smith, of New York, was received by him at the time of writing this book. It will be seen that he has been very successful in his business.
?Dear Sir : I have just returned from Europe, where I have been for some months. I am now going to write you a few lines on my return, as I think they may prove interesting to your readers.
I left London about the 1st of May last, and arrived here on the 20th of June. The first thing I did after landing was to call upon Mr. Wm. C. Whitney, Esq., of the firm of Whitney & Co., and inquire into their affairs. I found them in a flourishing condition, and everything looked prosperous. They were then engaged in the manufacture of cotton goods, and had recently commenced the manufacture of woolen goods. They had also recently opened a branch store in New York city, which was doing a good trade.
Mr. Whitney informed me that he had just sold out his interest in the firm to Messrs. Whitney & Co., and that he intended to retire from active business. He said that he had made a large fortune, but that he had no desire to accumulate more. He had always been a man of moderate means, and had never indulged in extravagance. He had always lived within his income, and had never borrowed money. He had always paid cash for all his purchases, and had never been known to make a bad bargain. He had always been a careful man, and had never taken unnecessary risks. He had always kept his accounts carefully, and had always paid his debts promptly. He had always been a man of integrity, and had never done anything dishonest. He had always been a man of principle, and had never compromised his principles. He had always been a man of honor, and had never broken his word. He had always been a man of faith, and had never doubted God's goodness. He had always been a man of hope, and had never lost his confidence in Providence. He had always been a man of charity, and had never forgotten his fellow-creatures. He had always been a man of love, and had never ceased to show his affection for his friends. He had always been a man of peace, and had never sought to injure his enemies. He had always been a man of justice, and had never done injustice to anyone. He had always been a man of truth, and had never told a lie. He had always been a man of purity, and had never committed any sin. He had always been a man of self-control, and had never allowed himself to be overcome by passion. He had always been a man of fortitude, and had never been discouraged by adversity. He had always been a man of courage, and had never been afraid to face danger. He had always been a man of wisdom, and had never acted without reason. He had always been a man of discretion, and had never acted without prudence. He had always been a man of moderation, and had never been carried away by enthusiasm. He had always been a man of temperance, and had never been led astray by wine. He had always been a man of chastity, and had never been tempted by lust. He had always been a man of piety, and had never neglected his religious duties. He had always been a man of gratitude, and had never forgotten his benefactors. He had always been a man of hope, and had never lost his confidence in God. He had always been a man of hope, and had never despaired of the future. He had always been a man of faith, and had never doubted God's goodness.

"Dear Sir,
I am returning home after a long absence of nearly two years. I left England at the beginning of last July, and returned here about the middle of October. During my stay abroad, I had the pleasure of visiting many interesting places, and of seeing much that was new and interesting. The principal object of my visit was to see the great Exhibition which has just closed its doors. It was one of the most magnificent exhibitions ever held in London. The number of visitors exceeded 100,000 per day, and the receipts amounted to upwards of L500,000. The exhibition was divided into three departments, viz., Art, Manufactures, and Agriculture. The art department contained some beautiful specimens of sculpture, painting, and architecture; but the greatest interest was excited by the fine collection of paintings, statues, and other works of art, brought from Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Holland, and other countries. The manufactures department contained a vast variety of articles, such as machinery, tools, &c.; while the agricultural department exhibited a large number of machines for tilling the soil, reaping, threshing, winnowing, grinding, &c. The whole exhibition was conducted with great taste and elegance, and was attended with every possible convenience. The public were admitted free of charge, and the admission fee was only 2s. 6d. each person.

The following letter from Mr. B. W. Hale, of New York, was received by us on Saturday evening, and published on Monday morning. It contains a very interesting account of the state of affairs in that city during the last few days.
Letter from Mr. B. W. Hale.
New York, Jan. 10, 1857.
Sir? I have just returned from New York, where I arrived yesterday afternoon. The excitement here has been intense for several days past. On Friday night, the 29th ult., the Legislature met, and passed a bill authorizing the Governor to call out the militia, and to suspend the writs of habeas corpus. This bill was passed without opposition.
On Saturday, the 30th, the Legislature adjourned, and the Governor issued his proclamation calling out the militia. At this time, the excitement had reached its height. The people were in a state of great agitation, and every thing looked like a revolution.
At noon, the Governor issued another proclamation, declaring that he would not issue the writs of habeas corpus, but that he would give notice to the people, and allow them to decide whether they would obey him or not.
This proclamation created a great sensation. The people were greatly excited, and many of them began to think seriously of resistance.
In the meantime, the Legislature met again, and passed a resolution, declaring that the Governor's proclamation was unconstitutional, and that the State should be put under martial law.
This resolution was carried unanimously.

The following letter from Mr. H. B. Morse, Esq., of New York, to his friend, Mr. J. W. Phelps, of this city, will be found in the next number of the Herald. It contains some very interesting facts relative to the early history of the telegraph.
Mr. Morse's Letter.
New York, Jan. 10, 1857.
Dear Sir,
I have been so much occupied by my affairs that I have not had time to write you since your last. I am sorry to say that I have not yet received yours of Dec. 29th. I shall now try to give you a full account of what has happened during the past year.
In the spring of 1856, I went to England for the purpose of purchasing the patent rights of the telegraph. The negotiations were protracted through the summer, and at length I succeeded in obtaining them. In the meantime, I had made arrangements with Messrs. Cooke & Wheatstone, of London, for the construction of the first line between Dover and Calais. This line was completed in August, and opened September 3d.
On the 4th of October, I returned to America, and proceeded to New York, where I arrived on the 10th. On the 12th, I called upon Mr. Vail, who had been appointed as one of the Commissioners of the Telegraph Company. We then proceeded to Washington, where we met the President, and other members of Congress.

Mr. B. W. Prescott, Esq.
New York, Feb. 2d, 1856.
Sir, I have just received your letter of Dec. 31st, 1855, and am very sorry to find that you have not yet returned to Europe. The present state of affairs in Turkey is such as to render it impossible for me to return thither without being exposed to great danger.
I shall therefore remain here until the arrival of the next steamer, when I hope to proceed to England.
I have no doubt but that you will soon follow me, and then we can meet again in London.
With kind regards to yourself and family, I am, Sir, Your obedient servant,
JOSEPH HENRY DAVIS.

The following letter from Mr. B. to his friend, Mr. J., will show how much he valued his friendship with him.
"My dear Friend," says he, "you have been a great deal more than a friend to me during these last few years. I am not sure that you do not think so yourself? But I know it, and I shall never forget it. It has been my greatest pleasure to be your friend. I have enjoyed every moment of our intercourse. I have felt as though we were two brothers, who had known each other from childhood, and who could talk about everything without reserve. I have often thought that I should like to live to see you again. I hope you may soon come back to this country. I shall then be able to see you oftener. I wish you would write to me frequently. I shall always remember what you say. I shall always feel grateful for your friendship."

Sentence: Arrived at Palermo, all our dovhtf were dispelled.
Corrected: Arrived at Palermo, all our doveflw were dispelled.
Their arrival was announced by a band of music playing
"God save the King." The people were very much excited,
and many of them went to the church to see the new king.
They were not disappointed. He looked like his father,
but he had a more pleasing expression. His hair was black,
his eyes blue, and his complexion fair. He wore a white
mantle over his shoulders, and a crown on his head.
He was received with great enthusiasm, and the whole
city was illuminated for several days.
The Queen Dowager, who was very fond of her son,
was delighted with him. She said that she would never
have consented to his marriage with Maria Christina,
had she known how handsome he was.
The King's first act after his accession was to abolish
the Inquisition. This was done by a decree which
he issued on the 1st of January, 1806.
The Inquisition was established by Ferdinand II.,
who was succeeded by Charles V. It was founded by
Alphonso X., and continued till the time of Philip IV.
It was abolished by Philip V.
The Inquisition was a tribunal composed of ecclesiastical
officers, who tried persons accused of heresy. They
were assisted by secular judges, who were appointed
by the King.
The Inquisition was divided into two branches-the
secular and the spiritual. The former dealt with civil
cases, while the latter dealt with criminal cases.
The Inquisition was abolished because it was found
to be useless, and because it was abused.
The Inquisition was abolished by a decree of the
King, dated the 1st of January, 1806.

"I have just arrived here after a pleasant journey," said she, "and I am glad to find you all well. I shall be happy to see you again soon."
"You are very welcome," replied Mr. B., "but I fear you will not be able to come often now. The place has become too dear to us."
"Why so?" inquired his daughter.
"Because my father has sold it," answered he.
"Oh! how sorry I am for him!" exclaimed the young lady.
"And why should you be sorry? It is better for him to sell than to live in poverty."
"But what can he do?" asked the young lady.
"He must go into business," replied Mr. B. "It is impossible for him to support himself as a farmer."
"Then he must leave this beautiful spot," said the young lady.
"Yes, he must leave it," replied Mr. B.; "he cannot remain here when he has no means of supporting himself."
"But where will he go?" inquired the young lady.
"To New York," replied Mr. B. "There he may make something of himself."
"But what will become of us?" inquired the young lady.
"We shall be obliged to move," replied Mr. B. "We shall have to seek a new home."
"What will become of your property?" inquired the young lady.
"That will depend upon the market," replied Mr. B. "If it goes down, we shall lose everything."
"But what will become of the poor people who live around here?" inquired the young lady.
"They will starve," replied Mr. B. "They will have nothing to eat."
"But what will become of them?" inquired the young lady.
"They will die," replied Mr. B. "They will perish from hunger."
"But what will become of the poor children?" inquired the young lady.
"They will grow up without education," replied Mr. B. "They will be ignorant and uneducated."
"But what will become of the poor women?" inquired the young lady.
"They will be forced to work for wages," replied Mr. B. "They will be compelled to toil for their bread."
"But what will become of the poor men?" inquired the young lady.
"They will be forced to labor for wages," replied Mr. B. "They will be compelled to toil for their bread."
"But what will become of the poor animals?" inquired the young lady.
"They will be driven away," replied Mr. B. "They will be turned out of their stalls and pens."
"But what will become of the poor birds?" inquired the young lady.
"They will be driven away," replied Mr. B. "They will be turned out of their nests and cages."
"But what will become of the poor insects?" inquired the young lady.

The following letter from Mr. Brougham to Lord John Russell, on the subject of the Irish Church Bill, was published in the Morning Chronicle of March 10th, 1856.
Mr. Brougham to Lord John Russell.
March 10, 1856.
Sir,
I have received your letter of yesterday, and am much obliged for the information you give me respecting the progress of the Irish Church Bill. The bill itself is a very bad one; but the objectionable clauses are those which relate to the appointment of bishops. It is impossible that such a measure can be passed without exciting great discontent among the Catholics of Ireland. They will feel themselves insulted by the idea of being governed by English bishops, who may be Protestant, and who may be even heretical. This feeling will be intensified when they see that the bill is supported by the most powerful party in England, and by the most influential members of the House of Commons.
It is true that the bill does not propose to interfere with the existing constitution of the church; but it proposes to alter it, and to introduce into it new principles, which cannot fail to produce its effects. The present constitution is founded upon the principle of episcopacy; and the bill proposed to substitute for it the principle of presbytery. In other words, it proposes to establish a system of government in the church, which is entirely different from what exists at present. The bishop is still the head of the church; but he is no longer the sole judge of ecclesiastical matters. He is only one of several judges, and he is appointed by the crown. The presbyters are also appointed by the crown; but they are chosen by the clergy, and they are elected by the laity. The bishops are still the chief officers of the church; but they are not the only officers. There are now three classes of officers in the church; namely, the bishops, the presbyters, and the deacons. The bishops are the highest officers; the presbyters are next in rank; and the deacons are the lowest. The bishops are the spiritual heads of the church; the presbyters are the temporal heads; and the deacons are the servants of the church.
This is the plan of the bill. But the question is whether these changes are wise? Whether they are necessary? Whether they are expedient? Whether they are just? These questions must be answered before we can decide whether the bill ought to pass. And I think it would be well for us to consider them seriously.
In the first place, I do not believe that the present constitution of the church is so defective as some people imagine. It is certainly defective in many respects; but it is not so defective as some people suppose. It is not so defective as to require a complete change. It is not so defective as to justify the introduction of a new system of government. It is not so defective as to render it necessary to abolish episcopacy altogether. It is not so defective as to prevent the establishment of a Presbyterian church in Ireland.
But, after all, the question is not whether the present constitution is defective; but whether it is desirable to alter it. And here I think it would be well for us to consider the consequences of such a change.
If the bishops were removed from their present position, and replaced by presbyters, the consequence would be, that the power of the crown would be increased. The bishops are appointed by the crown; and the presbyters are appointed by the clergy. The bishops are the chief officers of the church; and the presbyters are the second class of officers. The bishops are the spiritual heads of the church; and the presbyters are the temporal heads. The bishops are the chief judges of ecclesiastical matters; and the presbyters are the subordinate judges. The bishops are the supreme governors of the church; and the presbyters are the subordinate governors. The bishops are the spiritual rulers of the church; and the presbyters are the civil rulers of the church. The bishops are the spiritual fathers of the church; and the presbyters are the spiritual children of the church. The bishops are the spiritual guides of the church; and the presbyters are the spiritual assistants of the church. The bishops are the spiritual teachers of the church; and the presbyters are the spiritual preachers of the church. The bishops are the spiritual pastors of the church; and the presbyters

The following letter from a lady who was at the time of her visit at the Hotel des Invalides, Paris, will show how much she enjoyed herself :
"Mrs. A.," says she, "is a very agreeable woman, and I have had many pleasant hours with her. She is a great admirer of your country, and I am sure you will be pleased to hear that she has written me a most interesting account of your life here. She has also sent me some beautiful pictures of the city, which I shall treasure up among my souvenirs."
A few days after this letter reached us, Mrs. A. wrote again, saying :
"Dear Madam," said she, "I have received your kind letter, and thank you for it. It gives me pleasure to know that you enjoy yourself here. I hope you will not think me impertinent in asking you to write me often. I should like to hear more about your life here, and especially about your visits to the hospitals. I am anxious to learn all about them, and I shall feel gratified if you will give me any particulars. I am sure you must have seen many interesting sights during your stay here. I wish you would tell me something about them. I am particularly interested in the hospital where you were taken when you were ill. I have heard that it is one of the best in France. I should like to see it myself. I am sure you will not refuse to let me know anything about it. I am sure you will find it interesting. I am sorry you did not get well enough to go out with me on our excursions. I do not think you could have done so much good by going out alone. I am glad you went with me to the hospitals. I am sure you found them very interesting. I am sure you saw many things that you never saw before. I am sure you learned a great deal about the French people. I am sure you liked them better than you thought you would. I am sure you will come back here again next year. I am sure you will like everything here better than you expected.

"I am now writing you from Paris, where I have just returned after a visit of several weeks at the Hotel de Ville.
It was my intention to go to London, but on arriving here I found that the English Parliament had adjourned, and that all business was suspended until the 1st of May.
Therefore, I determined to remain here till the 20th, when the new session opens.

In the Salon d'Honneur, which is the principal room, there are two paintings by Raphael, and three by Correggio; in the Salle des Etats, there are four by Rubens, and six by Poussin.
The Hall of the Kings contains twenty-five pictures by Leonardo da Vinci, and thirty-seven by Michael Angelo.

The following letter from Mr. H. B. Morse, Esq., of New York, to the editor of the "New York Herald," will be found on page 107. It was written a few days after the publication of the above article.
Mr. Morse says :
"I am sorry that I did not see your paper before writing this. I should have been able to give you some additional information respecting the late lamented Mr. Wm. Cullen Bryant. The fact that he had been a member of the New York Bar for twenty-five years, and had been a judge of the Court of Appeals for ten years, would have enabled me to form a more correct estimate of his character than I could have done by reading the obituary notice which appeared in the 'Herald.'
"It appears to me that the writer of that notice has made a mistake in stating that Mr. Bryant died at the age of sixty-seven. He was born in 1805, and therefore must have been fifty-two when he died.
"As to the statement that he was a man of great literary attainments, I can only say that I never knew him to read a book. His knowledge of literature was confined to such books as were generally read by lawyers, and he seemed to think that all other books were mere trash.
"He was a very good lawyer, but he was not a great one. He was a very good judge, but he was not a great one. He was a very good citizen, but he was not a great one. He was a very good friend, but he was not a great one. He was a very good husband, but he was not a great one. He was a very good father, but he was not a great one. He was a very good son, but he was not a great one. He was a very good brother, but he was not a great one. He was a very good friend, but he was not a great one. He was a very good neighbor, but he was not a great one. He was a very good citizen, but he was not a great one. He was a very good man, but he was not a great one."
A Letter From A Friend Of Bryant.
Mr. Morse continues :
"I have known Mr. Bryant since 1846, and during that time I have seen him almost every day. I have also known many of his friends, and I know them to be honest men. I do not believe that they ever heard anything derogatory against Mr. Bryant. They have always spoken of him with the highest respect.
"I have no doubt that Mr. Bryant was a great man, but I cannot agree with those who say that he was a great poet. He was a good lawyer, a good judge, a good citizen, a good husband, a good father, a good son, a good brother, a good neighbor, a good citizen, a good friend, a good man, but he was not a great poet.
"If Mr. Bryant had been a great poet, he would have been a greater man. But he was not a great poet. He was a good lawyer, a good judge, a good citizen, a good husband, a good father, a good son, a good brother, a good neighbor, a good citizen, a good friend, a good man, but he was not a great poet.
"I do not believe that Mr. Bryant was a great poet because he wrote poetry. He was a good lawyer, a good judge, a good citizen, a good husband, a good father, a good son, a good brother, a good neighbor, a good citizen, a good friend, a good man, but he was not a great poet.

The following letter from Mr. H. B. Morse, Esq., of New York, to the Editor of the Herald, will be found at the end of this paper. It contains some very interesting facts relative to the life and character of General Jackson.
Letter from Mr. H. B. Morse, Esq.
New York, Jan. 15, 1861.
Dear Sir : I have been requested by several friends to write you a few lines relative to the late President Jackson. The subject is one which has always interested me deeply, and I feel that I can give you some information which may not be generally known.
General Jackson was born in South Carolina, near the town of Laurens, in 1767. His father was a farmer, who had emigrated from Ireland about the year 1749. He died when his son was but six years old. His mother then married Colonel John Drayton, of the Revolutionary army, who was killed at the battle of Camden, in 1780.
After the death of his mother, General Jackson was placed under the care of his uncle, Judge William Henry Drayton, of Charleston. This gentleman was a man of great learning and piety, and he early impressed upon his nephew the importance of religion. At the age of twelve, Jackson became a member of the First Presbyterian Church, of Charleston, where he remained until he left the city in 1787.
In 1787, General Jackson went to Philadelphia, where he studied law with the celebrated Chancellor Livingston, and was admitted to the bar in 1788. In 1790, he returned to South Carolina, and practiced law in Charleston.
In 1791, he was elected to Congress, and served two terms. During these years, he was a warm friend of Thomas Jefferson, and was instrumental in securing the appointment of the latter as Secretary of State.
In 1798, General Jackson was appointed Governor of Mississippi Territory, and removed thither with his family. Here he continued to practice law, and also engaged in agricultural pursuits.
In 1802, he was again elected to Congress, and served three successive terms. In 1808, he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to France, and during the next four years was employed in negotiating treaties of commerce between the United States and France.
In 1812, General Jackson was elected to the Senate, and served two terms. In 1817, he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain, and during the next five years was employed in negotiating commercial treaties between the United States and Spain.
In 1824, General Jackson was elected President of the United States, and served two terms. In 1832, he was re-elected, and served another term.
In 1835, General Jackson retired from public life, and settled down in retirement at his plantation, the Hermitage, near Nashville, Tennessee.
I have often heard my father speak of General Jackson's religious feelings, and how much he admired his piety and devotion. He said that he never saw a more sincere Christian than Jackson, and that he was one of the most devoted men he ever knew.
He was a firm believer in the doctrines of the Protestant Episcopal church, and was always careful to attend divine service every Sunday. He was a regular communicant, and would frequently say mass before breakfast.
When General Jackson was President, he was always punctual at church, and seldom missed a service. He was a frequent visitor at the churches of the city, and was always received with great respect.
I have often heard my father speak of General Jackson's love for his country, and how much he admired his patriotism. He said that he never saw a more devoted citizen than Jackson, and that he was one of the most patriotic men he ever knew.
He was a strong supporter of the Union, and was always ready to defend it against all enemies. He was a firm believer in the principles of the Constitution, and was always careful to uphold them.
I have often heard my father speak of General Jackson's love for his wife, and how much he admired her virtues. He said that he never saw a more faithful wife than Mrs. Jackson, and that she was one of the most virtuous women he ever knew.
She was a devout Christian, and was always careful to attend divine service every Sunday. She

The following letter from Mr. J. B. Hale to his friend, Mr. Wm.
B. Gould, will show how much he valued the friendship of that gentleman :
?Dear Friend, I have been very busy this week, but not so busily as you.
I am now at work on my new book, which I hope will be out before the end of the year.
It is called "A History of the United States," and will contain all the facts relating to our history since 1789.
I shall also give a full account of the present condition of affairs in Europe, and of the progress of the war.
I have just finished a chapter on the French Revolution, and another one on the Spanish War.
I have also written a short sketch of the life of Washington, and a few pages on the origin of the Federal Constitution.
I have taken great pains with these chapters, because they are the most interesting parts of my book.
I have also written a long article for the New York Tribune, entitled "The Present Condition of France."
This article has been published in the Tribune every day during the last two weeks, and has had a great deal of attention.
I have also written several articles for the same paper, upon the subject of the war between England and Spain.
These articles have been very popular, and have been reprinted in many newspapers.
I have also written a number of letters to different papers, upon various subjects.
I have lately received a letter from your father, informing me that he was going to visit you in Boston.
He says that he hopes to see you soon, and that he wishes to know whether you would like to come to New York with him ?
I think it would be very agreeable to you, and I should be glad to have you here.
If you do go to New York, I shall be delighted to meet you, and to take you over the city with me.
I shall be at home on Saturday evening next, and shall be glad to see you then.
I remain, dear friend, your sincere friend,
J. B. HALE.
Mr. Gould replied to this letter by saying that he would be happy to accompany Mr. Hale to New York, and to pay him a visit.

Mr. Houghton's Letter.
Washington, Jan. 10, 1856.
Sir,
I have just returned from Boston, where I had the pleasure of meeting you. I am sorry to say that your account of the Boston Whig is very incorrect. The paper is conducted with great ability, and is one of the best papers in the country. Its editor is a gentleman of high standing, and possesses all the qualifications requisite for the position he occupies. He is a man of great learning, and of great integrity; but above all things, he is a man of honor. His conduct towards me during my stay in Boston was most courteous and friendly. I shall always remember his kindness.
Yours truly,
B. W. Houghton.

The following letter from Mr. H. B. Morse, Esq., of New York, was published in the New York Herald on Saturday evening last :
?I have been requested by several friends to write you a few lines relative to the present state of affairs at Washington. I am not a politician, but as a citizen of this country, I feel called upon to express my opinion on the subject. The question now before Congress is whether we shall continue to exist as a nation, or whether we shall become a mere province of England. It is impossible for me to say what will be the result of the present contest. But I can tell you what has been the effect of the war upon our national character. We have lost sight of our own interests. We have forgotten that we are a free people, and that we have a right to govern ourselves. We have ceased to think of our own greatness, and have become too much absorbed in the greatness of Great Britain. We have become so much afraid of her power, that we have almost forgotten how great she really is. We have become so much accustomed to the idea of being governed by her, that we have almost ceased to think of the possibility of doing without her. We have become so much accustomed to the idea of being ruled by her, that we have almost forgotten how great a thing it is to be free.

The following letter from Mr. H. W. Beecher to a friend,
is one of the most interesting ever written by him. It was
written at the time when he was engaged on the "Life of
Washington," and contains many valuable hints for the
biographer.
"I have been reading over my notes with great care, and
have found that I have not done justice to Washington.
He has been so much misrepresented by the biographers
that I am afraid they will be disappointed in me. I shall
not attempt to write a biography; but I shall give you some
of the facts which I have collected during the last two
years, and which I think will be of interest to you.
"I have been very busy lately, and have had no leisure
to read anything else than what I have written myself.
I have been writing a life of Washington, and have made
a collection of all the letters which he wrote to his wife,
and also those which she wrote to him. The result of
this labor will be a book which will be of great value to
the public. I have been collecting materials for this
work for several years past, and have now nearly finished
it. I have been very careful in my selection of the
letters, and have endeavored to make them as complete as
possible. I have taken out all the repetitions, and have
given the whole story in each case. I have also omitted
all the private matters, such as the quarrels between
Washington and La Fayette, and the like. These things
are too personal to be published. I have also left out
all the political correspondence, excepting such as relates
to the Revolutionary war. This will be a very valuable
book, and will be of great service to the historian.

The following letter from Mr. H. B. Morse to his friend, Mr. J. W.
Brown, will show how much he valued the friendship of that gentleman. It was written on the occasion of his leaving New York for Europe.
"I have just received your kind letter, which I thank you for. I am sorry to hear that you are not well; but I hope you will soon be better.
You ask me what I think of the state of things here? I can only say that I think very little about them. I am too busy with my own affairs to give much attention to those of others.
I am going to Europe next month, and shall probably remain abroad until the end of the year. I shall return home in January, 1850.
I shall leave New York on the 2d of December, and shall sail from thence on the 3rd. I shall go direct to Liverpool, where I shall take passage on board the "Mary Ann," Captain
William C. Brown, who has been appointed by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions to go out as missionary to China.
I shall then proceed to Canton, whither I shall go direct, and thence to Amoy, where I shall stop some time, and make arrangements for my missionary labors.
After remaining at Amoy for a few days, I shall start for Shanghai, where I shall embark on board the "James Baines," Captain John A. Brown, and proceed to Macao, where I shall land.
From thence I shall go to Hong Kong, and thence to Canton, where I shall arrive on the 1st of February, 1850.
I shall then proceed to Amoy, where I shall stay till the middle of March, when I shall start for Peking, where I shall remain till the middle of April.
On the 17th of May, I shall set out for Tientsin, where I shall remain till the middle of June, when I shall start for Nanking, where I shall remain till the middle of July.
On the 16th of August, I shall start for Hangchow, where I shall remain till the middle of September, when I shall start for Kiangsi, where I shall remain till the middle of October.
On the 19th of November, I shall start for Chungking, where I shall remain till the middle of December, when I shall start for Lanchow, where I shall remain till the middle of January, 1851.

Tuesday Morning.
The following will be published to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock, by order of the Court of Directors of the Bank of England, in a large folio volume, containing the proceedings of the last twenty years of the bank's existence. The book contains the minutes of all the meetings of the directors, with the resolutions adopted; also the accounts of the bank from time to time, showing the state of its affairs, and the amount of capital subscribed. It is a most valuable document for the history of our country, and we shall give you a copy of it as soon as it can be procured.
A letter has been received from Mr. J. W. Bacon, Esq., solicitor to the Bank of England, stating that he has just returned from Paris, where he had been engaged in examining the books of the bank, and that he has found them to be perfectly regular and correct.
