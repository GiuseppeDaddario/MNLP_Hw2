A STRANGE CASE IN THE COUNTY COURT.
The Case of John H. Smith vs. William B.
Brown.
The following is a copy of the record of the case of John H. Smith against William Brown, which was tried before Judge Phelps at the term of court held on the 12th day of December last, and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff. The facts of the case will be found in the following narrative, which has been taken from the minutes of the proceedings.
John H. Smith, who was born in New York state, about twenty-five years ago, came to this county with his wife and children, and settled near the town of Northampton. He purchased land there, and built a dwelling upon it. His wife died soon after their arrival here, leaving him two sons and three daughters. In the year 1832 he married again, and removed into the town of Southampton, where he continued to reside until the present time.
William Brown, who was born in England, came to this county about ten years ago, and settled in the town of Northampton. He purchased land there, and built a dwelling upon it. He married a woman named Sarah, by whom he had one son, who is now about fourteen years old.
In the month of October, 1833, Mr. Smith went to the town of Northampton, and hired a room in the house of Mrs. Brown, who lived in the same street with her husband. On the evening of the second day of November following, Mr. Smith returned home, and found that his wife had left him, and gone away with her son, and that she had not written to him since. He immediately wrote to her, but received no answer. He then went to the house of Mrs. Brown, and demanded the custody of his wife and child. She refused to give them up, and told him that they were gone out of the city. He then took possession of the premises, and remained there until the next morning, when he went back to his own house.
On the morning of the third day of November, Mr. Smith went to the house of Mrs. Brown, and demanded the custody of his wife and child. She refused to give them up, and told him that they were gone out of the city. He then took possession of the premises, and remained there until the next morning, when he went back to his own house.
On the morning of the fourth day of November, Mr. Smith went to the house of Mrs. Brown, and demanded the custody of his wife and child. She refused to give them up, and told him that they were gone out of the city. He then took possession of the premises, and remained there until the next morning, when he went back to his own house.
On the morning of the fifth day of November, Mr. Smith went to the house of Mrs. Brown, and demanded the custody of his wife and child. She refused to give them up, and told him that they were gone out of the city. He then took possession of the premises, and remained there until the next morning, when he went back to his own house.
On the morning of the sixth day of November, Mr. Smith went to the house of Mrs. Brown, and demanded the custody of his wife and child. She refused to give them up, and told him that they were gone out of the city. He then took possession of the premises, and remained there until the next morning, when he went back to his own house.
On the morning of the seventh day of November, Mr. Smith went to the house of Mrs. Brown, and demanded the custody of his wife and child. She refused to give them up, and told him that they were gone out of the city. He then took possession of the premises, and remained there until the next morning, when he went back to his own house.
On the morning of the eighth day of November, Mr. Smith went to the house of Mrs. Brown, and demanded the custody of his wife and child. She refused to give them up, and told him that they were gone out of the city. He then took possession of the premises, and remained there until the next morning, when he went back to his own house.
On the morning of the ninth day of November, Mr. Smith went to the house of Mrs. Brown, and demanded the custody of his wife and child. She refused to give them up, and told him that they were gone out of the city. He then

THE BATHROOM WAS IN THE SAME CONDITION AS THE HALL.
The room was small, but neatly furnished with a few plain articles of furniture, such as a washstand, a toilet table, a sofa, a bed, and a dressing table. The walls were papered in imitation of wood, and the ceiling was painted in imitation of plaster. There was a large mirror on the wall opposite to the door, which reflected the whole apartment. It was a very handsome looking room, and would have been quite elegant had not the floor been covered with dust and dirt.
There was nothing remarkable about the furniture, excepting the toilet table, which was made of mahogany, and was beautifully carved. On this table was placed a small vase of flowers, and a little box containing some perfumes. The toilet table was placed near the window, so that the light from the window fell upon it.
On the other side of the room was a small closet, which contained a few dresses, and a few other articles of female apparel. These articles were arranged in a row, and were fastened together by a string.
At the end of the room was a door leading into another room, which was called the bedroom. This room was also neatly furnished, and looked much more comfortable than the rest of the apartment.
The bed was made of white damask, and was covered with a white counterpane. The curtains were of blue silk, and were trimmed with lace. The carpet was of green baize, and was laid over the floor.

THE GREEK REVOLUTION.
AUGUST 18TH, 1821.
The Revolutionary Movement in Athens.
The first of these was the "Society for the Liberation of Greece," which was formed at Smyrna on the 2d of August, 1821. It was composed of young men who were educated abroad, and who returned to their native country with the idea of liberating it from Turkish oppression. They were led by a man named Karaiskakis, who had been educated at Paris, and who had become acquainted with the ideas of the French revolutionists. He was a man of great ability, and possessed of considerable influence among his fellow citizens. His name became known all over Europe, and he was invited to come to England, where he spent some time in London, and afterwards went to Paris. Here he met with many of the most distinguished men of France, and became intimate with them. He was also very popular in England, and was much esteemed by the English people. In 1820 he returned to Greece, and began to organize the Society for the Liberation of Greece. This society was composed of about twenty members, who were mostly young men, and who were well educated. They were determined to free Greece from Turkish rule, and they believed that this could be accomplished only by force of arms. They were not afraid to use violence, and they were ready to shed blood in order to achieve their object. They were supported by a number of wealthy merchants, who were anxious to see Greece freed from Turkish domination. These merchants were willing to give money to the society, and they supplied it with funds. They also furnished the society with arms and ammunition. The society was divided into several branches, each of which was headed by a president. There were also committees appointed to look after various matters. The society published a newspaper called "Elliniki Epochi" (Greek Herald). This paper was edited by Karaiskakis, and it contained articles written by him and other members of the society. The society also sent agents to different parts of Greece, to collect information and to make preparations for the coming struggle. The society was very active during the summer of 1821. It organized meetings and demonstrations, and it distributed pamphlets and leaflets throughout the country. It also sent letters to foreign governments, asking them to intervene in favor of Greek independence. The society was very successful in its efforts. It gained a large following among the people, and it made a great impression on the public mind. The society was very popular in Athens, but it was hated by the Turks. The Turks regarded it as a dangerous organization, and they tried to suppress it. They arrested many of its members, and they imprisoned them in the fortresses of the city. But the society did not give up. It continued to meet and to publish its papers. It also sent agents to different parts of Greece, to organize resistance movements. The society was very important in the events leading up to the outbreak of the revolution. It helped to prepare the way for it. It gave the people courage and hope. It showed them that there was still hope for freedom. It inspired them with the desire to fight for their rights.

The old man said that he had been a seaman for many years, and had served on board several vessels of war. He had seen much of the world, and had often heard of strange things happening at sea. One day, when he was lying in his berth, he saw a light in the cabin door, and went to see what it was. The door opened, and there stood a young lady, who looked very pale and frightened. She asked him what he wanted? "I want to know," replied the old man, "what you have done with my father." "My father!" exclaimed the young lady; "you don't mean my father?" "Yes, madam," replied the old man, "my father is dead, and I am sorry to say that I have been guilty of murdering him." "Murdering your father! how could you do such a thing?" exclaimed the young lady. "Why, madam," replied the old man, "he was a bad man, and I thought it would be better for all parties if he were put out of the way." "But why did you kill him?" inquired the young lady. "Because he was a bad man," replied the old man. "And what made you think so?" inquired the young lady. "Because he was always quarrelsome, and used to get into fights with everybody about the ship," replied the old man. "Well, I never knew any one so bad as he was," said the young lady. "Then why did you kill him?" inquired the old man. "Because he was always quarrelsome, and used to get into fights with everybody about the ship," replied the old man. "Well, I never knew any one so bad as he was," said the young lady. "Then why did you kill him?" inquired the old man. "Because he was always quarrelsome, and used to get into fights with everybody about the ship," replied the old man. "Well, I never knew any one so bad as he was," said the young lady.

A STRANGE AND INTERESTING CASE.
TRIAL OF A WOMAN FOR THE MURDER OF HER HUSBAND.
Mrs. B. C. Smith, of New York City, Accused of Murdering her Husband by Poison.
The Trial at the Criminal Court.
The Evidence.
The Verdict.
The Plea for a New Trial.
The Appeal to the Supreme Court.
The Case Continued.
The Trial of Mrs. B. C. Smith, for the murder of her husband, Mr. John Smith, took place yesterday morning before Judge Swayne, at the Criminal Court. It was one of the most interesting cases that has ever been tried in this city. The evidence was very strong against the prisoner, but she made a good defense. She was acquitted.
The case was tried upon the following facts : On the evening of the 3d of December last, Mrs. Smith went to bed at her residence No. 40 West Twenty-third Street, in the city of New York. Her husband, who resided at No. 56 West Twenty-second street, came home about ten o'clock. He had been out all day. After supper he retired to his room, which was on the second floor. About half past eleven Mrs. Smith heard him move about in his room. She then went up stairs to see what he wanted. When she reached the door of his room, she found him lying dead on the floor. She immediately called the police, and they arrived within a few minutes afterward. They found the body lying on its back, with the head resting on the pillow. There was no sign of violence. The face was pale, but not blue. The eyes were closed, but there was no appearance of death. The hands were folded across the breast. The body was cold. The doctor pronounced the cause of death to be poison.
On the next day the coroner held an inquest, and returned a verdict of "Death from poison."
The prisoner was arrested on the same night, and taken to the police station. She was examined by Dr. Gould, and told him that she had been ill for some time previous to the death of her husband. She said that she had been suffering from a severe headache, and that she had taken a dose of quinine. She also stated that she had been taking a medicine for the headache, and that she had taken two doses of it. She said that she did not know how many times she had taken the medicine. She said that she had taken the medicine because she thought it would relieve her headache. She said that she had never taken any other medicine since the first dose.
Dr. Gould examined the prisoner again on the following day, and found that she was perfectly well.
The prisoner was brought before the court on the 17th instant, and arraigned on the charge of murdering her husband.
Mr. D. L. Patterson, counsel for the prosecution, asked the court to direct the jury to find the prisoner guilty of murder in the first degree.
Mr. E. F. Kellogg, counsel for the prisoner, objected to the question being put to the jury.
The judge overruled the objection, and directed the jury to answer yes or no.
The jury answered yes.
The judge then charged the jury to find the prisoner guilty of murder in the first degree.
The jury returned a verdict of guilty.
The prisoner was then sentenced to be kept in jail until the trial of the cause of her conviction.
The prisoner was then remanded to the custody of the sheriff.
The prisoner was then taken to the county jail, where she will remain until the trial of the cause of her conviction.
The prisoner was accompanied by her brother, Mr. William Smith, who lives in Brooklyn.
The prisoner was dressed in black silk, and wore a white bonnet.

A FEW MORE WORDS FROM THE SAME LETTER.
The following letter from a gentleman who has been long resident at Athens, is copied from the London Times of July 22d :
"I have just returned to England after a visit of several months to Athens. I am sorry to say that the city has not improved since my last visit. The streets are still dirty, the public buildings are still unfinished, and the population is still increasing. The number of foreigners is very great, and they are all living in the same quarter of the town. They are mostly English, French, Germans, Italians, Russians, and Americans. There are also many Jews, Turks, and Arabs. The Greek Government has done nothing to improve the condition of the city. It has only built some new churches, and has made some improvements in the public buildings. The people are still poor, and there is no prospect of any improvement for the future. The country around Athens is still very beautiful, but the inhabitants are very ignorant and superstitious. The women are very pretty, but they are very timid and reserved. The men are very handsome, but they are very proud and haughty. The language is still the ancient Attic dialect, and it is difficult to understand. The religion is still the old paganism, with some additions from Christianity. The government is still under the control of the Turks, and the people are still subject to their tyranny. The only hope for the future is that the Greeks may become more enlightened and civilized.
THE GREECE AND ITALY.
From the New York Herald of June 15th.
Italy and Greece are now on the eve of war. The Italian Government has declared war against Turkey, and the Greek Government has declared war against Italy. The cause of this war is the question of Venetia. Venice was once a part of the Turkish Empire, and was ceded by the Sultan to the Republic of Venice. In 1866, Austria took possession of Venetia, and the Austrian Emperor offered to cede Venetia to Italy. The Italian Government refused to accept the offer, and the Austrians occupied Venetia. The Italians then declared war against Austria, and the war lasted until 1867. At that time, the Treaty of Vienna was signed, by which Austria ceded Venetia to Italy. The treaty was ratified by both Governments, and the war ended. Since that time, the question of Venetia has been agitated between the two Governments. The Italians claim that Venetia belongs to Italy ; the Greeks claim that Venetia belongs to Greece. The dispute has been carried before the European Powers, and the Great Powers have decided that Venetia shall belong to Italy. This decision has caused much dissatisfaction among the Greeks, and they have threatened to take up arms against Italy. The Italian Government has replied that they will not give up Venetia without a struggle. The Italian troops have crossed the frontier, and are marching towards Trieste. The Greeks have sent a fleet to the Adriatic, and are preparing to resist the Italian invasion. The war is likely to be long and bloody.
FROM ATHENS TO ROME.
From the London Times of July 20th.
The Pope has written to the King of Naples, urging him to send troops to the assistance of the Greeks. The Pope says that he is sure that the Greeks will be successful, and that the Turks will soon be driven out of Europe. He adds that he hopes that the Pope will be able to persuade the other Christian Sovereigns to join the Greeks in the war. The Pope has also written to the King of Prussia, urging him to send troops to the assistance of the Greeks. The Pope says that he is sure that the Greeks will be successful, and that the Turks will soon be driven out of Europe. He adds that he hopes that the Pope will be able to persuade the other Christian Sovereigns to join the Greeks in the war.

THE BEGINNING OF THE END.
A NEW YORKER'S REMINISCENCES.
"I WAS IN THE CITY WHEN IT HAD A GREAT FIRE,"
Tells How It Happened.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT ANYONE
HAS TOLD HOW THE DISASTER CAME TO PASS ,
How the Fire Started and What Was Done
to Stop It.
NEW YORK , March 22. [ Special Telegram
to The New York Sun. ] I was In the city when
the great fire occurred. I had been there for
several weeks previous , and was returning home
from the country one evening last week. I
was walking down Broadway , looking at the
buildings , when suddenly I saw a column of
flame shooting up from the roof of the old
Broadway Hotel. I stopped and looked around
for some one who could tell me what was
happening. No one was near enough to see
what was going on , but as soon as I turned
around again , I saw that the flames were
spreading rapidly over the whole building.
At once I ran back to my hotel , and found
that all the other hotels were burning too.
I then went out to look after my own property
and found that everything was afire except
my own house. I returned to the hotel and
found that every building was ablaze.
I then started for the river , hoping to get
away before the fire reached us. When I
reached the ferry , however , I found that the
fire had spread so rapidly that we could not
get away. I then went to the police station
and asked them to send help to put out the
fire. They said they could not do anything
until the firemen came. I then went to the
fire department and told them how the fire
had begun. They sent a man to investigate
and he found that the fire had broken out
in the basement of the Broadway Hotel. He
then went to the hotel and found that the
fire had spread through the building by means
of the gas pipes.
When the fire broke out , the people in the
building rushed out into the street , and the
police officers tried to keep them back.
They did not succeed , however , and many of
them were killed.
After the fire broke out , the people in the
building rushed out into the street , and the
police officers tried to keep them back.
They did not succeed , however , and many of
them were killed.
The fire spread very rapidly , and before long
everything was ablaze.
I have never seen such a terrible sight as
this fire. It seemed like a dream.
I am glad that I escaped unharmed.
I will never forget the horror of that night.
THE FIRST REPORT FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.
The first report from the fire department
was received at headquarters at 11 o'clock last
night. The fire was reported to have broken
out about half past ten o'clock. The alarm
was given by the telephone operator at the
Central Telephone Company. The Central
Telephone Company is connected with the
fire department , and the operators are trained
to give the alarms.
The fire was discovered by the telephone
operator , Mr. J. M. McMahon , who was
working late at his desk. He heard a noise
coming from the basement of the Broadway
Hotel , and immediately called the fire depar
tmnt. He also telephoned the police com
pany , and the police company responded at
once.
Mr. McMahon was the first person to reach
the scene of the fire , and he gave the alarm
to the police company. The police company
immediately dispatched two men to the scene
of the fire , and these men arrived just as the
fire was breaking out.
The police company dispatched another
man to the scene of the fire , and this man
arrived just as the fire was spreading rapidly
through the building.
The police company dispatched another
man to the scene of the fire , and this

The Armenians were very much excited at the news of the murder of their king. They had been expecting a revolution in Armenia for some time past, and now that it has come they are greatly disappointed. The people here have no sympathy with the Armenians, and the only thing which can be done is to keep them quiet until the excitement subsides.
We left the town early this morning, and proceeded to the village where the Armenian lives. It was about two miles distant from the town, and we reached it before noon. The villagers were all assembled in the market place, talking loudly together. We asked one of them what was the matter? He replied that there had been a great disturbance in the capital, and that the Armenians had killed the king. We then went into the house where the Armenian lived, and found him sitting alone in his room. He was a tall man, with a long beard, and wore a black cloak over his shoulders. When we entered he rose up and bowed low before us.
"What do you want?" said he.
"We want to know why you did such a terrible deed as killing your king?"
"Because he was a traitor to his country," answered the Armenian.
"But how could you kill him without any proof against him?"
"Because he was a traitor to his country," repeated the Armenian.
"Then you must go back to your own country and fight against him."
"No, we shall never fight against him again," said the Armenian. "He is dead, and we shall never see him again."

TUB HERALD.
THE NEW YORK HERALD.
WEDNESDAY MORNING, JANUARY 27, 1839.
PRICE TWO CENTS.
The following is a copy of a letter from Mr. John W.
Brown, Esq., to the Hon. James Buchanan, Secretary of State,
of the United States, dated New York, January 16th, 1839.
Mr. Brown has been appointed by the President as one of
the commissioners for the settlement of the boundary line
between the United States and Mexico. The letter will be
found in the next number of this paper.
To the Honorable James Buchanan, Secretary of State, Washington City, D. C.?January 16th, 1839.
Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge your letter of the 14th ult., informing me that you have appointed me one of the commissioners for the settlement of the boundary between the United States and Mexico.
I shall feel much gratified by the appointment, which I regard as a mark of confidence on the part of the Government of the United States; but I am sorry to say, that I cannot accept it without some hesitation.
It may appear strange to you, sir, that I should hesitate to serve my country in such a capacity, after having served her faithfully during a long period of years, both in Congress and out of it. But I must confess, that I do not think myself equal to the arduous duties which would devolve upon me.
In the first place, I am now sixty-five years old, and have reached the age of life at which most men retire from active business. In the second place, I have been engaged in public affairs for so many years, that I have become somewhat weary of them. In the third place, I have no family to provide for, and therefore can devote all my time to the discharge of the duties imposed upon me.
But these reasons, though they might be sufficient to induce me to decline accepting the appointment, are not sufficient to justify me in declining it. I know that the duty assigned to me is important, and that it requires great care and attention. It is impossible for me to perform it satisfactorily unless I have the fullest information respecting the subject.
This information I could obtain only by personal investigation into the facts, and by a careful examination of the documents relating to the boundary question. These documents are scattered through different parts of the Union, and are scattered among different archives. They are also scattered among the various departments of the Government, and are often mislaid.
If I were to undertake the task of examining these documents, and of collecting the necessary information, I should require a considerable time to accomplish it. This time I could not spare. If I were to employ a clerk to assist me, he would be unable to give his whole attention to the work, and consequently would make mistakes.
These mistakes would be fatal to the success of our mission. For instance, suppose that I should find that the boundary line runs along the thirty-first parallel of north latitude, instead of along the thirty-second parallel. Such a mistake would lead us to conclude that the territory belonging to the United States extends farther south than it does.
Such a conclusion would be fatal to the interests of the United States. It would lead to the occupation of Mexican territory by American citizens, and would involve the United States in war with Mexico.
I am aware that there are other commissioners who are better qualified than myself to perform the duties required of them. But I am willing to undertake the responsibility, provided that I can rely upon the assistance of others.
I have already written to General Taylor, requesting him to furnish me with such information as I may require. I have also written to the Secretary of War, asking him to send me copies of the documents relating to the boundary question, which are kept in the Department of War.
I hope that the Secretary of War will comply with my request. If he does not, I shall be obliged to decline accepting the appointment.
I have the honor to remain, sir, your obedient servant, JOHN W. BROWN.

The following is from the New York Herald of March 10 :
"A few days since, at the house of Mr. J. B.
Hallock, in this city, a dinner was given for the benefit of the
New York Home for Aged Women. The guests were invited to
come early, as the entertainment would be short. They were
not disappointed. A very pleasant evening was spent in
conversation with the hostesses. Mrs. Hallock said that she
had been obliged to give up her home for some time past, but
that she had not forgotten the object for which it was built.
She said that she had always felt that there should be a place
where aged women might go when they could no longer care
for themselves ; where they could find comfort and peace ; and
where they could have their wants supplied without any
trouble on their part. She added that she hoped that the
home would never become too large for its purpose.
Mrs. Hallock said that she had often thought how much
comfort and happiness she owed to the kindness of those who
had taken charge of her during her illness. She thanked them
heartily for all they had done for her. She said that she
would like to see the home enlarged so that more old people
could be cared for. She said that she knew what it meant to
be alone and helpless. She said that she had seen many
cases of old age brought about by neglect. She said that
she had known cases of old men and women who had lived
alone for years, and who had died in poverty and loneliness.
She said that she had seen many cases of young children
who had been neglected by their parents, and who had died
in poverty and loneliness. She said that she had seen many
cases of young mothers who had been deserted by their husbands
and who had died in poverty and loneliness. She said that

A FEW MORE WORDS FROM THE COURT HOUSE.
The following is a copy of a letter from Mr. J. B. Hale, Esq., one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs in the case of the United States vs. John Brown and others, who was tried before Judge Story on the 12th day of May last. The letter is dated at Washington, D. C., May 20, 1859. It contains some interesting facts relative to the trial of this celebrated case.
?Mr. Brown has been acquitted by the jury of all charges against him. He was indicted for treason against the government of the United States, and for inciting slaves to rebel against their masters. The charge of treason was dismissed by the Court, but the other two were sustained.

SATURDAY , JANUARY 21 , 1837.
TWO NEGROES IN THE COUNTY COURT.
The following is a copy of the proceedings of the court held at the county seat of St. Clair county, Mich., Jan. 15, 1836. The case was tried by Judge Hutchinson, who presided.
The plaintiffs are John W. Smith and his wife, and William Smith, all colored persons, residing near the town of St. Clair, Michigan. They brought suit against the defendants, James and Mary Ann Smith, for the recovery of $200 damages, for assault and battery, committed upon them by the said James and Mary Ann Smith, on the night of the 14th day of December last.
The plaintiffs state that they were traveling from Detroit to St. Clair, when they met the defendant James Smith, who told them that he would give them a ride over the country, as he had no other means of transportation. The plaintiffs accepted his offer, and proceeded on their journey. After proceeding about two miles, the defendant stopped and asked the plaintiffs what they intended doing? They replied that they intended going to St. Clair. The defendant then informed them that he did not intend taking them there, but rather to take them back to Detroit. The plaintiffs then inquired why he should do this? He replied that he wanted to get rid of them. The plaintiffs then requested him to let them go on, but he refused. The plaintiffs then demanded that he should let them go, and threatened to leave him if he did not comply with their request. The defendant then took hold of one of the plaintiffs, and threw him down on the ground. The plaintiffs then attempted to rise up, but the defendant continued to hold them down. The plaintiffs then struck the defendant several blows with their fists, and finally succeeded in getting away from him. The defendant then pursued them, and after a short distance, caught them again, and again threw them down on the ground. The plaintiffs then struck the defendant several more blows with their fists, and finally succeeded in getting away from him. The defendant then pursued them, and after a short distance, caught them again, and again threw them down on the ground.

[2025-06-21 14:41:17] 🤖 Correction: The view from this seat would be what may prove to be a bird's-eye view. A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calvary, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and upon the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majesty decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it lost itself in the muddy waters of the river. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty oak and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studded the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I felt not so much pleasure as we did when we left this romantic spot. Our inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided here. None knew him but Domincio, his banker, who had gone to Candia. "Tbe Armenians," said our conductor, "could tell, but I am sure they will not," —"And cannot you tell, old friend ?" said I-"If I con," said he, "I dare not." We had not tresd to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learned several particulars of the isolated lord. Ho had parted eight young girls when he waa last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. Ho also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own In a gale , and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learned, which our old friend at the court house thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lad was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a pianoforte, and taught her herself the use of it.

A LETTER FROM THE HON. ALEXANDER BALDWIN TO MR.
BURTON.
London, Jan. 20, 1836.
Mr. Burton,
I have received your letter of the 19th ult., by which you inform me that you will be in London during the first week in February next. I shall therefore take this opportunity to express to you my sincere regret for not having seen you before now. It would have given me great pleasure to have had the honor of doing so. The time has been very busy with me since I left England, and I am afraid that I have neglected many things which ought to have been attended to. But I hope that you will excuse me, when I say that I have been engaged in preparing for publication a new edition of the works of Mr. Burke, which will contain all his political speeches, together with those of Sir Robert Peel, and other papers relating to public affairs. This work will be published early in March, and I trust that you will see it. In the meantime, I shall be happy to receive any information which you may think proper to give me respecting the state of public opinion in England, and particularly about the prospects of the Whig party. I should like to know whether there is any prospect of a dissolution of Parliament? If there is none, what do you think the chances are of a change of ministry? And how do you account for the extraordinary popularity of Mr. Canning? Is he likely to become Prime Minister? What do you think of the prospects of peace between France and England? Do you think that the French Government will make any concessions towards us? Are they likely to send out troops to Ireland? How do you account for the present state of feeling in Ireland? Have you any idea of the probable result of the election in Ireland? I am, sir, yours truly,

A LETTER FROM THE EASTERN STATES.
The New England States and Canada.
By a Gentleman Who Has Been There.
We have received from Mr. Wm. H. Bates, Esq., of Boston, a letter which he has written during his recent visit to the Eastern States and Canada. It is dated at Albany, N.Y., Jan. 12th, 1836. We give it entire as it appears in the Times.
I am happy to inform you, my dear sir, that I have had a very pleasant journey through the eastern states and Canada. The weather was fine, and the roads good. The scenery was beautiful, and the people hospitable.
In passing through the state of Vermont, I stopped at the village of St. Johnsbury, where I found a number of friends, among whom were Dr. and Mrs. Silliman, and Mr. and Mrs. Caleb Cushing. They gave me a most cordial reception, and invited me to spend the evening with them. After dinner, they took me out into the garden, and showed me their peach orchard, which was one of the finest I ever saw. In the evening, after tea, they gave me a lecture upon the subject of "The Origin of Species," by Charles Darwin, Esq. This lecture was delivered by Dr. Silliman, who is a man of great learning and ability. He spoke with great clearness and force, and made several points which were new to me.
After leaving St. Johnsbury, I went to Burlington, where I called on Mr. and Mrs. John Brown, and spent the night. On the following morning, I left for Hartford, where I arrived about noon. Here I met Mr. and Mrs. William H. Bates, and Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Dexter. I also called on Mr. and Mrs. James Russell Lowell, and spent the afternoon with them. At night, I dined with Mr. and Mrs. George Bancroft, and afterwards visited the city library, where I spent the remainder of the evening.
On the next morning, I called on Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Bailey Aldrich, and spent the forenoon with them. After breakfast, I called on Mr. and Mrs. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and spent the afternoon with them. After tea, I called on Mr. and Mrs. Edward Everett, and spent the evening with them.
On the following morning, I called on Mr. and Mrs. Francis Jackson, and spent the forenoon with them. After breakfast, I called on Mr. and Mrs. William Ellery Channing, and spent the forenoon with them. After tea, I called on Mr. and Mrs. Horace Greeley, and spent the evening with them.
On the next morning, I called on Mr. and Mrs. William Lloyd Garrison, and spent the forenoon with them. After breakfast, I called on Mr. and Mrs. William Cullen Bryant, and spent the forenoon with them. After tea, I called on Mr. and Mrs. William Cullen Bryant, and spent the evening with them.

I am glad to hear that you are well. I hope you will continue to enjoy good health.

Their nunnery was built by the order of King Henry II., who gave them a charter of liberties, which they have ever since enjoyed. The nuns were originally called "the Sisters of St. Mary Magdalene," but this name was changed into that of "the Poor Clares." They wear black habits, with white hoods, and their hair is cut short. Their rule is very strict, and they are not allowed to leave the convent except under special permission from the Abbess.
Their church is dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption, and contains many beautiful paintings and statues. It is said that one of these statues represents the Virgin herself, and that she is so lifelike that people often mistake her for a living person.
The Poor Clares are famous for their charitable work among the poor and needy. They give food and shelter to those who cannot afford it themselves, and also help to educate children who would otherwise be left without education.
They have been instrumental in founding schools throughout England, and have helped to improve the condition of many people.
The Poor Clares are a very important part of English history, and their influence can still be felt today.

A very pleasant and interesting evening was spent at Mrs. Harrison's on Saturday evening last by a large number of friends. The entertainment consisted of a musical program, which was rendered by Misses M. A. and E. C. Harris , accompanied by Mr. Wm. B. Smith. The songs were well chosen and sung with much taste and skill. After the music had been concluded, a reception was held in honor of the guests. The ladies wore white dresses and the gentlemen black coats. The table was decorated with flowers and the room was filled with fragrance from the delicious bouquets. The refreshments were served on fine china and silver. The cake was cut by the hostess and distributed to all present. The following presents were made :

I am sorry that you have been so much annoyed by the late publication of your letters. It was my intention to publish them in their entirety, but as they were too long for one number, I had to cut them up into two parts. The first part will be published next week.
The second part is now ready for press. It contains some very interesting and important matter.
It has been suggested to me that I should publish all the letters which I received from Mr. B. during the last few months. This would be impossible, as there are more than 1000 of them. I shall therefore select such as seem most interesting, and omit those which are merely personal.
I have also received several letters from Mr. B., written at different times, and containing various subjects. These I shall also publish.
In the meantime, I must beg you to excuse any mistakes which may occur in these letters. They are written in a hurry, and without revision.
I hope that you will forgive me for publishing them in this way.

The following is from the New York Tribune :
A NEW YORK STORY.
A few days since, in the city of New York, there was a great excitement among the people. The subject of this excitement was a young lady named Miss Lizzie Bates, who had been engaged for some time past as a teacher in one of the public schools of the city. She was a very pretty girl, about twenty years old ; but she was not so handsome as her friends thought her. Her father was a respectable merchant, and lived in a fashionable part of the city. He was a widower, and his wife died when he was quite young. His daughter was brought up by her mother, and was educated at a private school kept by a Mrs. Hewitt. This lady was a woman of good education, and had been connected with the family for many years. She was a widow herself, and had two children living. One of these was a boy, who was now about sixteen years old. The other child was a girl, who was about fourteen years old.
Miss Bates was a bright, intelligent girl, and was much admired by her teachers and companions. She was fond of reading, and was always ready to assist any one who wanted help in her studies. She was also very popular with the boys, and was often seen walking with them on the street.
One day, while Miss Bates was walking with a group of young men, she met a gentleman whom she knew well. He was a tall, handsome man, with a pleasant countenance, and a fine figure. He stopped and spoke to her, and asked her name. She told him that her name was Lizzie Bates. He said that he was Mr. John Smith, and that he was a lawyer. He then took out his watch, and looked at it. "I am sorry," he said, "to find that you have only just left your place of business."
"What do you mean?" asked Miss Bates.
"I mean," replied Mr. Smith, "that I am going to take charge of your affairs. I am going to manage your money for you. You will give me a check for five hundred dollars, and I will deposit it in the bank. Then I will draw upon my own account for the balance. If you want anything done for you, you can call on me, and I will attend to it. I shall be glad to serve you."
Miss Bates was surprised at what Mr. Smith said. She did not know why he should take such an interest in her affairs. But she felt grateful to him, and promised to do everything he wished her to do.
Mr. Smith went away, and Miss Bates returned home. She found that her father had written a letter to Mr. Smith, asking him to come and see her. When he arrived, he found Miss Bates waiting for him. He was astonished to see how beautiful she was. He was even more astonished when he heard that she was engaged to be married to him.
He was very angry, and said that he would never consent to marry her. But Miss Bates was determined to have him. She told him that she loved him, and that she would not listen to any objections.
Mr. Smith was very angry. He said that he would go to court and get a divorce from her father. He said that he would make her pay dearly for her disobedience.
But Miss Bates was not afraid of him. She said that she would fight him if he tried to harm her. And she kept her word. She fought him, and won.
After that, Mr. Smith never troubled Miss Bates again. He went back to his law practice, and Miss Bates became a teacher in one of the public schools of the city.
She was happy, and so were her parents. They were proud of their daughter, and they were thankful that she had found such a good husband.
The above story is true. It happened in 1850. It was published in the New York Tribune, under the signature of "Anonymous." It was reprinted in the Boston Courier, and in the Philadelphia Ledger. It has been printed in several newspapers in Europe, and in the United States. It has been translated into French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch, Polish, Hungarian, Bohemian, Czech, Serbian, Croatian, Servian, Turkish, Greek, Armenian, Persian, Hindoo, Chinese, Japanese, Malay, Siamese, Burm

A NEW YORK STORY.
The New York Tribune has published a letter from Mr. J. B.
Hayes, which we have translated for our readers. It is a very
interesting account of the proceedings at the meeting held by
the members of the Republican party on the 12th inst., to
elect a candidate for Governor. The result was that the
nominee was defeated by a majority of one vote.
Mr. Hayes says : "I am not aware that any member of the
Republican party ever before made such a statement as I
have just given. If he had done so, he would have been
denounced as a traitor to his party, and treated with the
utmost contempt. But this is no longer the case. The
party is now divided into two factions, each claiming to be
the true Republican party. One of these factions is
composed of those who were opposed to the nomination of
General Cass; while the other consists of those who were
in favor of it. The former are called the 'Old Guard,' and
the latter the 'New Guard.' The Old Guard are the old
members of the party, who were opposed to General Cass,
and who are still opposed to him. They are the men who
were always opposed to the nomination of General Cass,
because they thought he was too radical. They are the

All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing "traits" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.
