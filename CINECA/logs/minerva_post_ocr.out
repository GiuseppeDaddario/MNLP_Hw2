Sentence: THE VAMPYRE;
Corrected: The Vampyre; or, a Tale of the Dark
Fairy World. By John Polidori. 1809.
The following is a translation from the French of Mr.
Polidori's "Vampire," which appeared in the London
Monthly Review for July, 1816. It will be seen that
the author has not been guilty of any extravagant
imagination, but has faithfully followed the facts as

THE VAMPIRE; OR, A TALE OF THE DARK FAIRY WORLD.
By JOHN POLIDORI.
London, 1809.
I.
It was about midnight when I awoke from a deep sleep,
and found myself lying on my back upon the ground,
with my arms stretched out, and my eyes fixed upon the
sky. My first thought was, that I had fallen asleep
in the open air, and that some accident had prevented
me from returning home. But soon recollection
returned, and I remembered where I was, and what
had happened during the night.
I had been sitting by the fire with Lady Pembroke,
when she suddenly started up, and exclaimed, "Oh!
my God! what a noise!" She then ran into the room,
and returned with a lighted taper, and a book.
"What is this?" said she. "This is the work of the
Devil." And she opened the volume, and read these
words, "Behold, I am he that holdeth the sceptre of
death, that turneth men into wolves, and maketh them
to howl as dogs."
She then took the book again, and went to bed.
In the morning, I rose early, and went down stairs,
where I met Lord Ruthven, who told me that he had
been awakened by hearing a strange noise, and that
he had looked out of the window, and saw nothing.
He added, however, that he had heard something like
a groaning in the garden, and that he had gone to see
what it could mean. He then left me, and I went to
bed again.
About noon, I was awakened by hearing a loud knocking
at the door. I got up, and went to the door, and
saw two men standing at it. They asked me whether
I was alone? I answered yes. Then they asked me
if I would give them shelter for the night? I replied
that I would do so. They then entered the house,
and locked the door after them.
They were dressed in black, and wore masks over their
faces. One of them held a lantern in his hand, and
the other carried a large box. After they had gone
away, I sat down to think what had happened. At
length I recollected that I had heard a noise in the
garden, and that I had gone to see what it meant.
I now remembered that I had heard the sound of a
knife, and that I had seen blood on the floor.
I also remembered that I had heard a groaning in the
garden, and that I had gone to see what it meant.
These things came back to my mind, and I began to
think that I might have dreamt all this. But I did
not know what to do. I was afraid to go to bed again,
for fear of being murdered in my sleep. So I lay
upon the ground, and watched the moonlight through
the branches of the trees.
At length I fell asleep, and dreamed that I was
walking along a dark road, and that I saw a man
coming towards me. He was dressed in black, and
carried a lantern in his hand. When he came near
me, I recognized him as one of the men who had
come to the house. He stopped, and said, "Who art
thou?" I answered, "I am John Polidori." He then
asked me why I was walking along the road at such
an hour? I answered, "Because I am going to meet
some friends." He then said, "You must not go
along that road. Go another way." I then asked
him whither he was going? He answered, "To the
house of Dr. Frankenstein." I then asked him what
was the matter with him? He answered, "Nothing.
But you must go away from here." I then asked him
why he wanted me to go away? He answered, "Because
you are a friend of mine." I then asked him what he
