It appears that upon an examination of the cornmander-in-chief arid magistrates of the place positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain heyduck named Arnold Paul had been record to say, that, at cassava or the frontiers of the Turkish servo had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the euji, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grove, and rubbing himself with his blood. This prccaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himels; sor, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having 6een tormented by him, and a deposition was made that four persons had been deprived os life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and f found it (a is supposed to be usual in cares of vampirism corruptjon, and emitting at the rnouth, riose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the bear and body of Arnold Paul at which he is reported to hauecried out cos dreadfully as is he had been olive. This done, they cut of his head, burned his body, and threw the asses into his grave.

But though the common adulteress could not influence ever the guidance of hi eyos, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was tho apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent davghter, that few knew heaver addressed himself to semaIos. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongues and whether it was that it even ouercarne the fix dread of his singular character or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as after among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among the who sully it by their vices.",
  "13": "About the me time there come to London a your gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died whole he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind lo the care of mercenary subalterns he cultivated more his imagination than hi judgment. He had, hence that highromantic feeling of honor and candour, which daily ruins so many milliner's apprentices. Fix He believed all to sympathize with virtue and thought that vico was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to tho painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought in sine that the dreams os poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frarik, and rieh: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles many mothers surrounded bim, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the drug her at the same time by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the ram once of if solitary hours he was startled at finding, that in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in recall life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes from which he had formed his study. Fjnding, however, some compensation in bis gratified vanity he was about to reliriqvishhis dreams when the extraordinary being we have above dcscrjbed, crossed him in his career.",
  "14": "He watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character af a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of if observation of external objects than the tacit assent to their existence implied by the avoidance of their contact imagination to picture every thing that scattered its propensity to extravagant ideas formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather thane person before him. He became act painted with him, paid him attentions and so say advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized He gradually learnt that Lord ruthann's affairs were embarrafsod, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respelling this regular character, who till now, had oily whetted his curiosity he hinted to his guardians that i was time for him to perform the taur, which for many generations has been tbougbl necessary to noble 16e young to take some rapid steps in the career of nice towards putty no themselves upon an equality with the owed allowing them to appear as if faller frown the skies, whenever scaridalovs intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of pralse, accordlrig to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and aubrey immediately mentioning bis intentions to Lord Ruthveri was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flat uttered by such a mark of esteem frown him, who apparently had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it and in a few days they had passed the circling waterf.",
  "15": "Hitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord ruthann's character, and now he fovnd, that, though many more of bis actions were exposed to his viow, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse ln his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more thai enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous the misfortunes attendant even upon virtuc, that he bestowed his cllms; these were sent from the fix door with hardly suppressed sneers not when the profligate carne lo ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him lo wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquily, he was sent away with rich charity. Fix This was however attributed him to the greater importunity of tho vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent There was ono circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there's a curse upon it they were all either led to the seaffaId, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject mjsery. At Brussels and stick t owns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the enters of all fashionable vice into allah spirit af the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more thai he gainod; but it was always fix with the same unchanging face with which he generally watched the society around however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice or the buckles father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's lathis apparent abstractedness of mind was said aside and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the hal dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorncd, curing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sate that had drawn him within the reach os this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic midst the speaking looks of mute hungry children without a single farthing of his late immune wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to fcltisfy their present craving. Yet ho took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruined of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of theinnooent fix of a certain degree of knowledge, which was riot however, capable of ouinbatirig the running of the more expo erienoed. Aubrey often wished to represent t6j to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of aIl and did not tepid to his own profit for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred Lord ruthie in his carriage and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the samo: hi eye spoke less than his lips and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that knavery which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural",
  "16": "They soon arrived to Romc, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted cily. Whilst he a thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his gvardians, the latter astonished hims if it had here entered into his imagination that the was fix an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason forth belief His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the a distress had not originated in hatred of hercharacters but that he had required to enhance his gratification, that his victim the partner fix of his guilt should be hurled from the pinnclcIe of unsullied virtue, dowry to the lowest abyss of infamy and dogradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account fix of their virtue, hod since his departure thrown even the mask aside and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze",
  "17": "Aubrey determined upon leaving one, whose cbclracter had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. Fix He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while to watch him more closely and to let no slight circurnslances pass by unnoticed He entered into the me car cle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavoring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society marry on his plans in secret; but audrey's eye fallowedhim in all his winding that an asflgnatlon had been appointed, which would most likely and in tho ruin af an innocent though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked hin his intentions with respect to the lady informing him the same time that be was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord ruthie answered that his intentions were such as he supposed call would have upon such an occasion; and upon 6 being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughcd. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must declare accompanyjnghis Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon tho another of the lady, inf opined her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord ruthie next day merely son hi servant to notify his complete assent to a separation did not hint any suspicion ofris plans having been foiled by audrey's interposition",
  "18": "Having lest Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as hirnself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to portray on carcass the promised hope the faithful in Mahomet's paradise savothat her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plan or tripped along the mountain's side one would have thought the gazelle a poor type her becluties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of bathe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a cashmere bulterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, sloatirig as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decypbcred pori an almost effaced tablet in the contemplation of her sylph-Iire figure Often would her tresses falling as she flitted around, exhibit in the s on ray such delia tell brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary who let escape from his mired the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation os a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate youth and beauty unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native places she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain would paint, to him in all the glowing colors af youthful memory, the marriage pomp he remembered viewing in her irifancy; and then, turning to subjoctsthat had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind would tell him all the supernatural talks of her nurse Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narratod, excited tho interest even of Aubrey; and often she told him the tale of the living vampire what had passed years amidst his friends and dearest tles, forced every year by feeding upon the life of a lovely small to prolong his existence for the ensuing months his blood would run cold, whilst be attempted to laugh her out fix of such die and horrible fantasles; but bathe cited him the rimes os olden who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children hod been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found hire so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof giveri, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to con fess it was trve. She detailed to him the traditional appearance os these monsters and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description os Lord Rulhven he, hawevck till persisted in persuading her, that there could be na truth in her fears though at the same tire he wondered at the marry coiricidencos which had all tended to excite a belief in tho supernatural power of Lord Ruthuen.",
  "19": "Aubrey began to attach himself more clad more to bathe affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for bis vision of romance, won his heart; and whole he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him Fix He would teak himself ofttimes from her and, forming a plan for sore antiquarian reseclrch, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention pori the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an ignore that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his tboughts. Bathe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known She always seemed to part from him with roluclarices but it was because she had rio longer any one with whom be could visit her favorite haunts whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which bad yet escaped the destructive hand of time She had appeared ta her parents on the subject of vampires another both, with sick al present affirmed their existence, pole with horror at the very name. Sori after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursion, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they beard the name of the play ce, they all at once be aged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily past through a wood, where greek would ever remain, aster the day bad closed, upon any conideration. They described it as the resort of the vampires in their nocturnal orgies and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey knave light of their representations and tried to laugh them out of the idea saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superiar, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.",
  "20": "Next morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended melancholy face of bis host, and was concerned to sind that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends had Inspired them with much terror When he was about to depart bathe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged os him to returri, ere night allowed the power os these boris to be put in action He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that daylight would soon and and that In the horizon there was one of those specks which in the former cllmates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass and pair aIl their rage upon the devoted country. He at last, however mounted his horse determined to mark up by speed for his delay: hut it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost vnknown; immediately tho sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the start wolf above's echoing thunders had scarcely fix an interval of resits thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at hi very feet Suddenly his horse took srighl, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, clad he found, 6y the glare of lightning, that he was iris the neighborhood of a novel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approachcd, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at last trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached the lhunders, fora moment silent allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery os a laugh, continued iris one almost unbroken sound sudden effort, forced opera the door os the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guidedhim. He was apparently unperceived for, though he called, still the sounds continued and no notice was taken of bim. He found himself in con tall with some one, whom he immediately eized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled! \" to which a loud laugh succeeded and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life cos dearly as he could, he struggled vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon hisbreast, had placed bis hands upon his thraatwhen the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed hims he instantly rose and, leaving his prey rushed through the door, and in cl moment the crasbirig of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was rio longer heard. The storm was now stills and Aubrey incapable os moving, was soon heard by those wilbout. They entered the light of their torches fell upon the mad walls and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries in darkness but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once make burst upon hin perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corse He shut his eyes, hoping that it was not a vision arising from his disturbed imagination again saw the same form when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no color upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet th ere was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A vampire A Vampyre! \" A filter was quickly formed and Aubrey waylaid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts werehis mired was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular constrvction, which had been found in the hut They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged the search of be wham a mother had missud. Their lamentable cries cos they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful cotastrophe. To describe their grief would be impossible; but whether ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died brokenhearted",
  "21": "Aubrey being pvt to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious intervals he would evil pori Lord Rothvcn and upon Ianthehy some unaccountable combination he seemed la beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved Fix At other times he would imprecate maledictionsupon his head, and curse him as her destroyer Lord Rotten chanced at this time to arrive al Athens and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey immediately placed himself in the same house andbecame his constant attendant When the latter recovered from his delirium he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord ruthie by his rind words implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety and care which showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed he na longer appeared that apathetic being who had o astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his eunvalescerice began to he rapid, he again gradually retired fix into the same state of mirid, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon hire with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haul need him. During the last take of the invalid's recovery, Lord ruthie was clppclrently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breozo, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, fire our world, the loveless fun Indeed he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all",
  "22": "Audrey's mind, by this sbock, was much weakened and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lard ruthie solitude, his mind could nat find it in the neighborhood of At hens; if he sought it amidst the ruins head formerly frequented, panthers form stood by his side he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning rovnd, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded lhroat, with a meet smile upon her lips. Ho determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in if mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he head himself bound my the tender care he had taken af him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction and sought every spot to which o recollection bovid be attached but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not ta heed what they gazed opon. They heard much of robbers but they gradually bear to slight these reports which they imagined were only the invention of individvals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. Fix In consequence af thus rieglceting the advice of the inhabitants on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile at the bottom of which was the bed of a torront, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighboring precipiees, they had reason to repent their negligence for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Rothocn and Aubrey imitating their example retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a fue, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take whom in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they loft the shelter of the rock, when Lord ruthie received a shot in the shoulder which brought him to the grourid. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril surprised by seeing the robbers faces around limbs guards having, upon Lord ruthann's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendored.",
  "23": "By promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighboring cabins arid having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presencethey being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord ruthann's trengthrapidly decreased advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not chonged; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he bad been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy andy's eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with mare than usually earnestness\"Assist me You may save meou may do more than that mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence a little as that of the passing days but you may save my honour, your friend's hour \"\"How?

But, when be had mounted to the summit he sound no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they bad laid the body.

While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto or to Naples he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over and examining their curious forms what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in t60 same style as the dogger discovered in the fatal the shuddcredhatening to gain further proof, he found tho weapon, and his borrow may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though pucoIiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand.
