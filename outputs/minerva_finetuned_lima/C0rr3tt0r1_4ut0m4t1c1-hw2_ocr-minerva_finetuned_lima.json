  "3": "The superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the helias existed, that vampires nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and quickly died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened - and their veins became distended to such a state of ruptility, causing the blood to flow from all the passages of their badies, and even from the urethra of their skin.",
  "4": "In the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious account of a particular case of vampirism, which is stated to have occurred at Máriagóta, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the cornmander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been bceen declared to say, that, at Cassovia, ori the frontiers of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grove, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; sor, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having seen him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants have consulted their Hadagni, taken up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cafes of upheaval) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and issuing at the north, red, and ears, pure and fine blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the bear's body and head of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out loudly as he had been. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw him ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corpses of those individuals who had previously died of pneumonia, lest they should, in turn, become contagious to others who survived them.",
  "5": "The universal belief is that a person bitten by a vampire becomes a vampire himself, and then sucks in his turn.",

  "7": "This monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other resistance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst alive, that the deceased is not alone doomed to vampirism, but obligated to confine his infernal visits solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom be was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"",
  "8": "But first on Earth, as Vampire sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There shall thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet late be the banquet which perfor’d Must feed thy living corse, Thy victims, ore they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their fire; As changing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yel thou must end thy task and inark Her cheek's last trace—her eye's last gleam, And the last glassy glance must view Which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unbloody hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock was born— but now is borne away by thee Memorial of love! Yet with thy own blood shall drip; Thy gnashing teeth, and baggy lip; Then standing to thy sullen grave, Go—and dry up with Ghosts and Afrids rage, Till these in horror shrink from sight More accursed than they.",
  "9": "Mr. Southey introduced also intruded in his wild bull heavy poem of \"Thalaba,\" the complexure of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having been revived from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being portrayed throughout the entire tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tourncf0rt gives o long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been eye-witness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides various anecdotes, and traditional narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned discourses, tendinq to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbaric error.",
  "10": "Many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; however, the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which in any case can now be concluded simply remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms used in various parts of the world: as Vrouchocha, Vardouca, Goul, Broucola, &c.",
  "11": "The vampyre.",
  "12": "It happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parts an honorable gentleman, in more remarkable for his singularities, than for his rank. He gazed upon the merriment around him, as if he couldn't participate therein. Apporently, the light laughter of the fair orily attracted his attention, that he might by a look quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not comprehend when it arose: some attributed it to the dead gray eye, which, fixing up on the object's face, seemed to penetrate, and at once pierced through to the inner working of the heart; but fell upon the body with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every ball; everyone wanted to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent exciting, and now felt the weight of a new something in their possession capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or strength of passion, its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after nature tried to win his attention, and some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shown in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on a mantle, to attract his notice; though in vain:—though he was apparently looking at her, yet it seemed as if his eyes were unperceived;—even her unimpressed innocence baffled, and she left the room. But though the common adulteress could not influence everi the guiding of her eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to semais. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and wherhever it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as ofter among those who form the boast of the jr sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.",
  "13": "About the same time, there came to London a gentleman of the name of Aubrey; he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet young. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candor, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathize with virtue, and thought that virtue was thrown in by providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances; he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted in the want of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and varied colored patches. He thought, in his mind, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their lingering or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, so led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the rawness of hif solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from lack of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that collection of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his vanity, he was about to relive his dreams, when the extraordinary being above described, crossed him in his career.",
  "14": "He watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of them: allowing his imagination to picture everything that struck its tendency to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the background of a romance, and decided to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the pursuer. He became acquainted with him, paid attention to him, and so soon recognized his presence, that his presence was always recalled. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassing, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in - Street, that he was about to travel. Desiring to gain some informal recognition respecting this singular character, who, until now, had only orily whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians that it was time for him to perform the task, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable young men to take some rapid steps in the career of virtue towards putting themselves upon an equality with the other sex, and not allowing them to appear as if favourites from the skies whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of pride, according to the degree of skill shown in carrying them on. They consented: And Avbrey immediately mentioned his intentions to Lord Ruthver, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fla-",
  "15": "Hereafter, Aubrey would have a chance to study Lord Ruthven’s character, and now he has found out that, although many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results differ from what appears to be his true intentions. His companion was profusely liberal; — the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar received more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtue of the virtuous, red-veined tints attending even upon virtue, these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; — these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; 6ut when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his iniquity, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquitously, he was sent away with rich charity. This was however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous. There was one circumstance about his lordship, which was still more impressed upon him: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the sea, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the entrances of all fashionable venues; there he entered into all spirits of the faro table: he bet, and always gambled with success, except when the known sharpers were his opponents, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unwavering face, with which he usually watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he met the rash young novice, or the unfortunate younger brother of a wealthy family; then his very wish seemed to be Fortune's law - this apparent abstractedness of mind threw me off, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat while dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the state that had drawn him within the realm of this fiend; while many a father sat frustrated, clutching the speaking looks of mute starving children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, with which to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; immediately lost, to the ruin of many, the last gold he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the ignorant: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not only capable of operating on the mind, but also of improving its powers. Aubrey often wisbeds to represent tbjs to his friend, and begs him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of aIl, and does not tell him to do so; — but he delays it — for each day he hopes his friend will give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurs. Lord Ruthuen in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lips; and you were near the object of your curiosity, but you got no greater satisfaction from it than the constant excitement of wanting to break that mystery, which to your exalted imagination became something supernatural.",
  "16": "They arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened eagerly; the first came from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guards, the latter astonished him; if it had entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed sufficient reasons for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediate leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adulteress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he required, to enhance his gratification, that his wife should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in short, that all those women whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had now, since his departure, thrown away the mask, and had not hesitated to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.",
  "17": "Aubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He tried to come up with a plausible excuse for leaving him entirely, intending, meanwhile, to watch him more closely, and to let no small circumstances go unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his lordship was endeavoring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to keep his plans in secrecy; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his wanderings, and soon discovered that an appointment had been made, which would most likely result in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven replied, that his intentions were such as he supposed they would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, simply laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that framed that moment he must declare accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the other lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.",
  "18": "Having let Rome, Aubrey dashed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of free men only before slaves, had hidden them under the sheltering soil or many covered lichens. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have surpassed the model for a painter wishing to portray on canvas the promised hope of mankind, save that her eyes spoke too much of mind for anyone to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of horse; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited only to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kafhmeer butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, slothful as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just deciphered up on the table, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Ofen would her tresses fall, as she flitted about, exhibiting in the sun such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mirror the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate? It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. While he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memoir for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youth, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her imagination; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited even the interest of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living upstart, who had passed years amid his friends, and dearer ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely semi-culture to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood ran cold, whilst she attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the remnants of old times, who had finally detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relations and children had been found marked with the mark of the devil's appetite; and when she found him incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, since it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given them, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and how he still persisted in persuading her, that there could not be truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the miraculous coincidences which had all tended to confirm a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.",
  "19": "Aubrey began to attach himself more closely to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had seen the sight of romance, won his heart; and while he considered the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attracted to her almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself apart from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention on the surroundings around him, while in his mind he retained an idea that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and remained the same frank insatiable being he had first known. She always seemed to prefer him with romantic conversations; but it was because she had no one with whom she could visit her favorite places, while her guardian was busy drawing or uncovering some secret which had not yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents about the subject of Vampires, and they both, with some present, affirmed their existence, pole with horror at the very name. Soori after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him sor a few hours; when they bearded the name of the place, they all at once be gged of him not to retvrn at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, excepting on any consideration. They described it as the resart of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey ran down the hallway, trying to shake off the idea; but when he saw them shiver at his daring so to mock a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.",
  "20": "Next morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to see that his words, mocking the boldness of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly hegged on him to return, before night allowed the power of these boys to be put into action; — she promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day would soon come, and that in the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the warmer climate, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour out all their rage upon the devoted country. — He finally, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the starry sky above - its echoing thunder had hardly an interval of rest - its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopy-ing foliage, whilst the blue fire seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took a fright, and he was carried through the tangled forest at a dreadful rate. The animal finally, through exhaustion, stopped, and he found that the glare of lightning, that he was in the vicinity of a cow that barely lifted itself up from the masses of dead caves and brushwood which surrounded it. Disregarding, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mixing with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; — he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found him in utter darkness: the sound however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in combat with someone, who he immediately seized. When a voice shouted, “Again defeated!” followed by a loud laugh, he felt himself grabbed by someone whose strength seemed superhuman. Determined to sell his life dear as he could, he struggled, but it failed. He was lifted from his feet and thrown with tremendous force against the ground. His enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling on his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat. When the glare of many torches piercing through the opening illuminated the room, disturbed him. He immediately rose, and leaving his prey rushed through the door, and in a moment the crash of branches as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those about. They entered; The light of their torches fell upon the muddy waters, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more made their way into the airy form of her fair conductress brought in a lifeless corse. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was just a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he opened them, stretched beside him. There was no color upon her cheeks, not even on her lips; however, there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as eerie as the life that once lived there: - Upon her neck and chest was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein. To this the men pointed, crying simultaneously, \"A vampire! a vampire!\" A lighthouse was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid beside her who had recently been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were - his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and took refuge in vacancy - he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the house. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search for her whom she missed. Their lamntable cries, clas they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corpse. They were inconsolable; they died broken-hearted.",
  "21": "Aubrey being private to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; during these intervals he would eat up oranges and upon Irene—how some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to shoot the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Rutbervne, chance at this time arrived at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a vampire; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His 1ordship seemed quiet changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescent began to heal rapidly, he again gradually withdrew into the same state of melancholy, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid’s recovery, Lord Ruthven was clearly engaged in watching the tranquil waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, as our world does, the motionless fun; indeed, he seemed to wish to avoid the eyes of all.",
  "22": "Aubry’s mind, by this stroke, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amid the ruins he had formerly frequented, Iris' form stood by his side - if he sought it in the woods, her light step appeared wandering among the undergrowth, in search of the mildest violet; then suddenly turning round, she showed him her pale face and wounded lip, with a meek smile on her lips. Determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in my mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he had bound the tender chain he had taken from him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece which he had not yet seen. Travelled in every direction, and searched every spot to recall a conquest: but though they had halted from place to place, yet they seemed not to have heeded what they looked upon. Tbcy heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight the sc reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, who had a personal interest in exciting the generosity of those whom they defended from supposed dangers. In consequence of this receiving the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defense. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torront, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipiees, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whizzling of bullets close to their heads, and by the crackling of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placirig themselves behind rocks, they had gun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthucn and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting words bid them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lifted the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him down. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—bis guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.",
  "23": "By promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a nearby cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence - they being content merely to guard the entrance until their companion returned with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthuen’s strength rapidly declined; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His coronary artery and appearance had not clogged; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects around him: but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with greater than usual earnestness—\"Help me! you may save me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I hear the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? let me how? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my life ebbs away—I cannot explain everything—but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour would be free from stain in the world's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rising up with extraordinary violence, \"swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for one year and a day, you will not disclose your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living creature in any way whatsoever, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see.\" —His eyes were bulging from their sockets: \"I swear!\", said Aubrey; he fell back upon his pillow, and took no further breaths.",
  "24": "A ubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep. The many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered how coldly he had shivered over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel where he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was not there, having been conveyed by himself or some companions, upon retiring, lo the foot of a neighboring mountain, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold rays of the moon that rose after his departure. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of them, decided to go and find it on the spot where it lay. But when had been mounted to the summit he sounded no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the cl0lhes.",
  "25": "Weary of a journey in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and irritated by all apparently conspiring to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. Waiting for a vessel to canvey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. While turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently orriamented in the same style as the dogger discovered in the fatal hole—he shrunk—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his breath may be imagined when he discovered that it fit, though poorly shaped, the sheatb he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty - they seemed bound to the dagger; still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the handle and sheath were alike in splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.",
  "26": "He left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she hadn't been heard of since her departure from his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated blows; he was afraid that this lady had fallen victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. Hc arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed more eager than his will, soon carried him to the English shore; and he went to meet his mother's friends, and there, for a while, forgot all about the past. If she before, by her infantinc caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.",
  "27": "Miss Aubrey had not a single grace which gained the gaze and attention of the drawing room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blush was never lightened by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that indicated a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was that light footstep, which strays wherever a butterfly or colour may attract-it was sedate and thoughtful. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy ; but when her brother breathed to her his affectionate greeting, and forgot his sorrows, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the happy ? Who would have exchanged her face for that of the pure and spotless? She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her preservation should be deferred until her brother's return from the continent, when she might be his protector. The next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entrance into the busy scene. Aubrey would rather have remained a recluse in the mansion of his father, and fed upon the incense of the past. He could not feel interested about the frivolities of fashionable society, when his mind had been so much disturbed by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.",
  "28": "The crowd was excessive -a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the royal presence hurried thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While ho was standing in a corner by himself, bereft of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place-he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized toowell, sounded in his ear -\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blot out his existence; but perceiving, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his attention on his first entrance into this city, he perceived also that the same personage who had spoken to him then, was now before him. He groaned until his limbs almost refused to support him, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forging a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hastened steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if afraid that his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstantia It was impossible that it could be real-he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hurl upon his lips, and he failed not in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Pursuing, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entered another room, where he found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation. He attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. TlE SENTENCE IS NOW CORRECTED BY THE FOLLOWING NOTES.",
  "29": "Auyre became almost distracted. If his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the impending danger pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that he intrusted her with explaining to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His aat startled him ;-was he to allow this monstrous ?to roam, blighting ruin upon his breath, and against all that he held dear, and not to avert its progresses? His very sister had been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and reveal these suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing himself to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been struck. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, hc did not eat, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roomed from street to street, anxious to flee that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was not longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he lay down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon disconcerted by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any -from thought. His conduct, however, sudderily chariged. Struck with the idea that he had left behind him the whole of his friends, with a demon among them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter society, and watch carefully, despite his oath, all those who approached him with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudders so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, the society which offected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved vain, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.",
  "30": "Desirous of saving him from the injur* and suffering he had dale encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly noticed it, so completely had his mind been absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherent eomaikea became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would oftentimes lie for days, unable to be aroused. He had become emaciated, his cies had attained a glassy lustre;-the only sign of affection and remembrance remaining displayed itself upon his sister ; then he sometimes started, and, seizing her hand, with looks that severely affected her, he would say not to touch him. Oh, do not touch him-if your love for me is anything, do not go near him ! When, however, she asked who he meant, her only reply was, \"True! true!\" and again he sunk into a state of stupor, from which she could not rouse him. The last few months have been very trying to him; but gradually, as the spring passed on, his mental condition improved, and he began to count upon his fingers a definite number of days, and smiled.",
  "31": "The lime had nearly elapsed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy cir Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom? Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking that it was a young earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his desire to be present at the wedding, and wishing to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his father was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, which with tears fluttering at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feeling of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait In a paroxysm of rage, and tramped It under his feet. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future bride, he looked as if he did not understand her- then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a strange expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never marry this monster, for he— But he could not advance—it seemed as if his voice again bade her remember her oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthuen was near him but saw no one. In the meanwhile the guardians and physicians, who had heard all, and thought this only a return of his disorder, entreated her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, begged of them to deIay but for one day. They, by their artful representations, endeavored to make him insane, and compelled him to retire from public life.",
  "32": "Lord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. Where he heard of Aubrey's illness, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but where he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He has been to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in her affairs, he has gained the ear of Miss Avery. Who could resist his power? His tongue had perils and toil to recover-could speak of him as of an individual having no sympathy with any being or object upon the crowded earth, except where she was concerned ;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence began to be worthy of preservation, if only that he might hear her soothing counsels. The title of the elder ranch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spito of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.",
  "33": "Aubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, appealed to the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own birthright, and the honor of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for one hour that marriage, on which he declared the most heavy curses. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by what he considered the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the noises of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of corks broke upon his ear. AUBRY GROWED ALMOST FRAUDLESS. The curiosity of the servants finally overcome their vigilance, they gradually slipped away, leaving her in the custody of a helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound he was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him; he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the floor, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear- \"Remember your oath, and know, if not my day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail! So flinty, he pushed him towards his aunts, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage at finding himself defeated broke a blood-vessel, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he received it, as the physician feared of exciting her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.",
  "34": "Aubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the nea He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related confidentially what the reader had perused—he died immediately after.",

  "39": "In sailing through the Greek Archipelago, on board one of His Majesty's vessels, in the year 182, we put into the harbour of Mitilene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certainty of having cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it- both men of war and merchants; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repaid for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the mouth of the bay, and while the men were engaged in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who was on his way to visit him. He engaged me as a pupil, and would hav taken me with him; but I did not choose to marry Millyle, where I am likely to get married. He was odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old mansion in charge of Dominick, the merchant, for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sailed in his felucca very often to the different islands,",
  "40": "This account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hurrying to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. The house was built of brick, and had been recently painted. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, rnable tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaping posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book case; there were no mirrors, except one picture. The bedchamber had merely a largo mattrass spread upon the floor, with two stuffed coton quilts and a pillow-common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. The tablet on the table contained the works of Voltaire, Shakespear, Boileau, and Racine; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmermann, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of those books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was generally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which were remarks.",
  "41": "The old man said : \"The Lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others ; but ,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return ; for he is so particular , that were I to remove one thing without orders , he would frown upon me for a week together ; he is very good. The first time he did me a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zecchinos which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a little cottage in the woods, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why?",
  "42": "The appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico fronting on the street was five feet long and fourteen wide, and the fluted marble pillars with six narrow pedestals and fret-work cornices, as it is now customary in Greek architecture, were considerably larger than the room. The roof, surrounded by a light sloping balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. The most of the houses are furnished, upon which the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.",
  "43": "The streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed mary of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very de",
  "44": "The view from this seat would be what might be termed a bird's-eye view. A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calvary, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and upon the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majesty decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods' base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty oak and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studded the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. We rarely enjoyed a view so fine than we did on this occasion; but our inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude; none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. The Armenians,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure they will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I do,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learned several particulars of the isolated lord. He had partied eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also purchased a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learned, which our old friend at the court house thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lad was often seen walking on the shore, and he had bought her a pianoforte, and taught her herself to play upon it.",
  "45": "Such was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Miletene; our imagination all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money; he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doveflw were dispelled. Failing to make a good bargain with Mr. Foster, the architect, a pupil of Wyatt's, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on the island of Tenedos, and also visited him at Mitilene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Chief Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcutta in every page. We deeply regretted not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mytilene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good reputation, which has been grossly slanderous. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to soothe its woes, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions; and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being upon whom Religion has set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her inonlt. No man can read the preceding paragraph without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love* or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly where directed against man's moral integrity; and be who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, even the most guilty of his fellow-men. Lord B*rn's character is worthy of his genius. To do good secretly, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.",
