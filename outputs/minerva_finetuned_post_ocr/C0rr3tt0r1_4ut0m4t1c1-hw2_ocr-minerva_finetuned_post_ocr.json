  "3": "The superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appeares to be common : It did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity ; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek Churches ; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a living body could not be buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the hieys existed, that compelled nightly to imbibe a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened -and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the pores of their skins.",
  "4": "In the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious account of a particular case of vampirism, which is stated to have occurred at Madraia, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the coroner-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmae, that, about five years before, a certain Hueyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been convicted to say, that, at Cassovia, or in the frontiers of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grove, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; sad, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants have consulted their Hadrai, took up the body, and found it fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the north, rose, and ears, pure and fragrant blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake waa driven entirely through the body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out clas dreadfully as he had been before. This done, they cut off his head, burnt his body, and threw him into the ashes. The same measures were adopted with the bodies of those persons who had previously died of yellow fever, lest they should, in their turn, become contagious to others who survived them.",
  "5": "The universal belief is, that a person bitten by a vampire becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.",

  "7": "This monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not anly doomed to vampirism, but compelled to confine his infernal visions solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth-those to whom be was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Jaouur.\"",
  "8": "But first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There shalt thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet live the banquet which perforne Must feed thy living corse, Thy victims, ore they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their fire; As cursed thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yea thou must end thy task and inark Her c h eek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freezes o'er its lifeless brow; Then with unballowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock were born A pledge of love, but now is borne away By thee memorial of her agony! Yet with thy own blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and baggard lip; Then stabbing to thy sullen grave, Go-arid with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till thefe in horror shriek away From spectres more accursed than they.",
  "9": "THE NEW YORK TIMES. Southey has also introduced In his wildly poetic drama of Thalaba, the character of Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting her best beloved while in existence.But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being portrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a perfect type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tourncf0rt gives out long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been eye-witness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned disquisitions, tendinlng to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbaric error.",

  "12": "It happened that In the midst of the dissipations attending upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parts of the leaders of the ton and nobleman, in remarkable for his singularities, this gentleman. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not partake therein. The light laughter of the fair orily attracted his attention, that he might by a look quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain when it arose : some attributed it to the dead gray eye, which fixed upo'r the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inner working of the heart ; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every ball, all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their possession capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attention, and flung themselves in his way, and tried all means to gain his affections, and even made love to him, though he was too much occupied with his own feelings to notice them. Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster exhibited in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mantua, to attract his attention; but still it seemed as if his eyes were unobserved by her, though his countenance was evidently fixed upon her. But though the common adulteress could not influence ever the guidance of her eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him; yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to seductions. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as ofter among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.",
  "13": "AUBREY, OF LONDON, AN ORPHAN, Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many millinery apprentices. He believd all to sympathize with virtue, and thought that vic was thrown in by providence merely for the picturrceal efect of the scene, as we see in romances; he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted in the wearing of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and varied colored patches. He thought, in his dream, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich; for these reaons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. As he was attached to the raam of lonely hours, he waa startled at finding, that, exceptiu in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there waa no foundation for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation for his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dream, when the extraordinary event which we have above described, crossed him in his career.",
  "14": "He watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to paint every thing that struck its tendency to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the bed of a romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his fancy, rather than the persons around him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so gradually advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Wall street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some informalion respecting this singular character, who, till now, had orily whetted his curiosity, he hint* to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the task, which for many generations has been necessary to enable him to take some rapid steps in the career of life, towards putting himself upon an equality with the governed, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever serious intrigues are mentioned as the subject of pleasantry or of politics, according to the degree of skill shown in carrying them on. And they consented; and Avreby immediately mentioned his intentions to Lord Rufver, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flagrated by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.",
  "15": "Hitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of bis actors were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;-the idle , the vagabond , and the beggar , received from him more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtue of the virtuous, red-faced, and degraded, that he looked for relief, but upon their vices, which he did not hesitate to expose ; these were sent from the door with scarcely suppressed sneers ; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his iniquity, or to sink him still deeper in his depravity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind; all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the sea, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other places through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable circles: he bet, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharpers were his antagonists, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging countenance, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the unfortunate brother of a wealthy family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind waived aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat while dallying with the half dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the loneliness of a dungeon, the state that had drawn him within the realm of this fiend; while many a father sat famished, clutching the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, with which to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet ho took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruin of many, the last guilder he had just snatched from the grasp of the inexpert: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not only capable of winning the game, but also of making the loser pay for his losses. Aubrey oft* wsspwbd to repre<>t* this to his friend, and b?g him to resig*n tha charity and pleasae which proved the ruine of aI, and did not desire to do any thing for his own profit; but he deferred it, for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opporunity of speaking franlly and openly to him; howevr, this never occurred. Lord Ruthuen In his carriage, and amid the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtaiugtno greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of wanting to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination became something supernatural.",
  "16": "They sailed from Rome, and Aubrey lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he was in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. While he waa engaged in this manner, letters arrived from England, containing nothing but affectionate expressions of love and friendship. The other ones were from his guardians, who seemed astonished at his sudden change of sentiments. If it had entered into his imagination that there was a malignant power resident in his companion, these letters seemed to give sufficient ground for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adulteress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to exalt his gratification, that his companion, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation; in fine, that all those females who he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.",
  "17": "Aubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean time, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstantial circumstances escape notice. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his lordship was endeavoring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefor obliged to accompany on his plans in secrecy; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his winding-f, and soon discovered that an appointment had been made, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with regard to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying him in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the other lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his secretary to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.",
  "18": "Having left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek ; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hid themsleves beneath the sheltering soil or many covered lichens. Under the same roof as herself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have been the model for a painter wishing to portray on canvas the promised hope of the faithful in Mohammed's parable, saying that her eyes spoke too much for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of animal; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited only to the taste of an epicure. Tbe light step oft* often accompanied Aubrey In his search after antiquities, and often wore the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kaffhmerer fly, show the whole beauty of her form, sailing as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just deciphered upore an almost erased tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Ofen would her tresses falling, as she flitted about, exhibit in the sun's rays such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who escaped from his misfortune the very object he had before thought of as vitally important to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. While he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memoir for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic efects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youth, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her imagination, and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the superstitious tales of her nurse. Her earneslness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampire, who had passed years amid his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely sister, to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, her blood ran cold, while endeavoring to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but I anted her cited to him the remembrance of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relations and children had been found marked with the mark of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, though it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given them, which obliged them, with grief and heart-breaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could not be any truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the coincidences which had all tended to confirm a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.

When we learn something new, our brains create new connections between neurons. These connections allow us to remember information and perform tasks more efficiently.",
  "19": "Aubrey began to attach himself more closely to Helen; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had thought of romance, won his heart ; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, yet he found himself more and more attached to her. He would tear himself off from her, and, forming a plan for some antiqjraphical research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it imposible to fix his attention upon the relics around him, while in his mind he retained an idea that seemed akin to the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe waa unconscious of hi* love , and was ever the same frank insatllng being he had first known. She always seemed to parr from him with a laugh ; but it was because she had reo longer any one with whom she could visit her favorite haunts , while her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some sagrmenls which bad yet escaped the destructive hand of time. Shc had appeaied to her parents on the subject of Vampires, and they both, with sevcr alarming present, affirmed their existence, pole with horror at the very name. Soori after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him some hours; when they be-gded of him not to returne at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, except on any consideration. THE VAMPIRE STORY. Aubrey rade light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.",
  "20": "Next morning Aubrey set out upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to learn that his words, mocking the boldness of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly he gibbed him to returri, eare before night allowed the power of these boys to be put in action ;—he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that daylight would soon dawn, and that in the horizon there waa one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour out their rage upon the devoted country. -He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay; but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately tho sun sets, night begins : and ere he had advanced far, the power of the star*'s echolng had scarcely an interval of rest ; its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopy *>i?g, while thc blue flamed lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with terrible rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and clad he found, that he was in the neighborhood of a cow that hardly lifted herself up from the masses of dead lava and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at last trusting to obtai As he approached, the hunds, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; -he was startled : but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found him in utter darkness; the sound however ,guided him. He was apparently perceived ; for, though ho called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in conflict with some one, who seized him immediately; when a voice shouted, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh followed; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman; determined to sell his life dear as he could, he struggled; but it waa in vain; he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground; his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat; when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that he had made, disturbed him; he immediately rose, and rushing through the door, left his prey, and ran through the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now severe ; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those about him. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more made their way into the room, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corse? He shut his eyes, hoping that it was a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he opened them, stretched by his side. There was no color upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as appalling as the life that once dwelt there: -upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein. To this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A lilter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind seemed benumbed and shun reflection, and took refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar construction, which had been found In the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whereabouts. Their lamentable cries, clt they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. - To describe their grief would be impossible ; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corpse. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - They were inconsolable ; but they did not die broken-",
  "21": "Aubrey being pvt to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious ; in these intervals he would ealop upo Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe-hcy some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to shoot the being loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lard Rutbevn, chance* at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him who had now come with that of a Vampire; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His 1ordship seemed changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescentre began to he rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of melancholy, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him with a smile of malignant exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile had made him uneasy. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was clearly engaged In watching the tide-waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the motionless fun; -indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eye of all.",
  "22": "AUBRY'S MIND, BY THIS BACK, WAS MUCH WEAKENED, He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lard Ruthven ; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighborhood of Athelney. If he sought it amid the ruins he had formerly frequented, his form stood by his side- if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering among the underwood, in quest of the mildest violet; then suddenly turning round, she would show him, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded lip, with a meek smile upon her lips. Ho determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations In my mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender regard he had taken for him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece which he had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which recollection could be attached; but though they thus had lain hastily from place to place, yet they seemed not to have heard what they gazed upon. Tbey heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight the sc reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals who had their own selfish interests in view, and whose object it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from supposed dangers. In consequeuie of thia advlce, they travelled with but few guard*, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which waa the bed of a torront, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipiees, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whizzing of bullets close to their heads, and by the cheering of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, they were obliged to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthucn and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting fhouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the r0bbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they loft the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him - bis guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.",
  "23": "By promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence- they being content only to guard the entrance until their companion should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthuen's strength rapidly declined ; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conrt and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects around him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! you may save me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the preceding day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, your honour, \"-His eyes seamed bursting from their sockets : \"I swore !\" said Aubrey ; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.",
  "24": "Aubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep ; the many circumstancs attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered how cold a shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising earl'y in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself or companions, upon retiring, to the door of a neighboring mountain, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his departure. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and by it upon the spot where it lay. But when be had mounted to the summit he sounded no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clergy.",
  "25": "Weary of a courilry in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appeared to conspire to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved lo leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to carry him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects which he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there waa a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. While turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal haft? He shuddered, for he knew not whither this weapon had come from; but, ere he could make any further examination of its form, he found the sheath, and his heart may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though poorly shaped, the sheatb he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty-they seemed gaaing to be bound to the dagger; yet the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.",
  "26": "He left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of her lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated boroors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent ; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions , as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. Hc arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed abedierit to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hcarded to the mansiori of his fatbers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infant incaresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.",
  "27": "Miss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and attention of drawing-room assemblies. There waa no lightih brightness which only exis* In the heated atmo- Her blieu eye waa never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There waa a melancholy charm about it , which did not seem to arise from misfortune , but from some feeling within , that indicated a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was rapid and light, which strayed where a butterfly or colour might attract-it was sedate and thoughtful. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy ; but when her brother breathed to her his affectionate look, and would in her presence forget the sorrows he knew had disturbed his repose, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the happy ? It seemed as if those eyes, that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She wa* yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her preservation should be deferred until her brother's return from the continent, when she might be his protectress. It waS now, therefore, resoIved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the busy scene. Aubrey would rather have reined In the mansion of his fathers, and fed up on the incoherent which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the fashions of fashionable society, when his mind had been so troubled by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived In town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.",
  "28": "Tbe crowd wa* exceeeeive, and all who were anxious to bask In the royal light, hurried there. Aubrey wa* there with his sister. While ho wa* standing In a corner by himself, bereft of all thought of all around him, engaged in the re-mem-brance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized toowell, sounded in his ear, \"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blot out his existence, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his attention on his first entrance into this city. He went out with a feeling of weakness in his limbs, and was obliged to lean on the arm of a friend, and then drove away in his carriage, and felt weak. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if be was afraid that his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him ? cir It was impossible that it could be real ? he determined, therefore, to go again into society ; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hurried upon his lips, and he failed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Putting himself out of the way, he entered another room, where he found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation. He attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forc'd her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, be again heard that voice - \"Remember your oath!\"- He did not dare to look round, but, hurrying his sister, so quickly reached home.",
  "29": "Auyre became almost distracted. If befara his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the intruder's return pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that he intrusted to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. THE MORE HE THOUGHT , THE BETTER HE WAS BEWILDERED. His aat startled him ; was he to allow this monstrous to roam , causing ruin upon his breath, aiding ruin upon all he held dear, and not averting its progresses ? His very sister had been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose these suspicions, who would believe him? For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, hc did not eat, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roomed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected and he wandered, as oft* exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was not longer to recognize ; at first he returned with the evening to the house ; but at last he lay down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follo His conduct, however, soared. Struck with the idea that ho left by his absence tho whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter into society, and watch carefully, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudders so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, company which offected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved vain, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.",
  "30": "Desirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had dale encountered in his wanderings, and of preventirig him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hard*ly noticed It , so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherency became so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would oftentimes lie for days, unable to be roused. He had become emaciated, his chests had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and remembrance remaining displayed itself upon his sister ; then he would sometimes start, and ,seizing her hand, with looks that severely affected her, he would say not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him-if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she asked who he referred to, her only reply was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, from whence she could not rouse him. Thi? last lasted many moths : gradually, however, as the year was passlng, hia incoherencces became less frequent, and his mind began to brighten up, while his guardians observed, that on certain days he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.",
  "31": "The lime had nearly elaps'd, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy cir Instantly Aubrey's attention waa attracted ; ho asked anxiously to whom ? Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking that it was a young Earl who he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing bis irritation to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his father was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile ; for he pressed her to his bosom, and kissed her cheek, weeping at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feeling of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life? He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled upon It. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future bride, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a stern expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he— In the meanwhile the guardians and physicians, who had heard all, and thought this was only a return of his disorder, entreated him to leave her. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, begged of them to deIay but for one day. They, atraetlng this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavored to pacify him, and reccreived.",
  "32": "Lord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. Where he heard of Aubrey's illness, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but where he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. Ho hadstoned to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in her, he gradually won the ear of Miss Avery. Who could resist his power? His tongue had perils and toil to recover - could speak of himselve as of an individual having no sympathy with any being or ihe crowded earth, save with her who he addressed himself ;- could tell how , since he knew her , his existence had begun to seem worthy of preservation , if it were only that he might listen to her consolations. The title of the elder ranch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spito of her brother's deranged state,) wbich was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.",
  "33": "Aubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, at length attempted to break loose, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own birthright, and the honor of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for one hour that marriage, on which he declared the most heavy curses. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by what he considered the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the noises of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of cor AUBRY'S BALLOON. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame the vigilance, they gradually slipped away, leaving her in the custody of a helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound he was out of the room, and in a rapid manner found himself In the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him : ho imme When on the floor, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear- \"Remember your oath, and know, if not my daughter's day, your sister is dishonored. Women are frail !\" So flinty, he pushed him towards his aunts, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself ; his raging fever , had broken a blood-vessel , and he was confined to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he erited, as the physician waa afraid of agitating her. The marriage waa solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.",
  "34": "Aubrey's weakness increased ; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the nea*r approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related confidentially what the reader had perused—he died immediately after.",

  "39": "In sailing through the Greek Archipelago, on board one of His Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitilene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certlre supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it- both men of war and merchants ; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repaid for the deviation of a voyage. We landed? as usual, at the bow of the bay, and while the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mt. IDA (a small mountain so named) we met wi?nd engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us ho had come from Sciro with an English lord, whosoilost the last few days previous to our arrival in his felucca. He engaged me as a pupil, and would have taken me with him ; but I did not choose to quit Millylea, where I am likely to get married. He waa an odd , but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old mansion in charge of Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constant1y; for he sailed in his felucca very often to the different islands,",
  "40": "This account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hurrying to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor ? an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting room, and a bed-chamber, with a large closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, rnarble tables on either side, a large myrtle tree in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a reclining posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case; there were no mirrors, except one, and that was broken. The bedchamber had merely a largo mattress spread upon the floor, with two stuffed cot- In the sitting room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. The tablet is the recess, and contains the works of Voltaire, Shakespear, Boileau, Raussoue, Volney, Zimmerman, Klopstock, Milton's Paradise Lost, a German edition, printed at Parma in 1810, severa1 small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of those books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, In Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which were remarks.",
  "41": "The old man said : \"The Lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others ; but,\" said he , \"there they must lie until his return ; for he is so particular , that were I to remove one thing without orders , he would frown upon me for a week together ; therefore be careful not to do anything without his leave.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zecchinas which I pay to an old Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know for what reason.",
  "42": "The appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico fronting on the street was five feet long and fourteen feet wide, and the fluted marble pillars with six flutes and fret-work cornices, as it is now customary in Greek architecture, were considerably larger than the porch. The roof, surrounded by a light slone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the houses are furnished, upon which the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as lachryma Christi , eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.",
  "43": "On the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and lemons were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed mary of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sunday.\"",
  "44": "The view from this seat would be what may prove to be a bird's-eye view. A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calvary, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and upon the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majesty decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it lost itself in the muddy waters of the river. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty oak and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studded the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I felt not so much pleasure as we did when we left this romantic spot. Our inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided here. None knew him but Domincio, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"Tbe Armenians,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure they will not,\" —\"And cannot you tell, old friend ?\" said I-\"If I con,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not tresd to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learned several particulars of the isolated lord. Ho had parted eight young girls when he waa last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. Ho also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own In a gale , and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learned, which our old friend at the court house thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lad was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a pianoforte, and taught her herself the use of it.",
  "45": "Such waa the information with which we depaired from the peaceful isle of Mitilene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident : he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our dove* were dispelled. Failing in a com Foster, the architect, a pupil of Wyatt's, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on the island of Tenedos, and also visited him at Mitilene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we bad been some years from home; but \"Chief Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcala in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not altogether uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good reputation, which has been grossly slanderod. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to soothe its woes, or add to its pleasures. The fact Is directly the reverse , and may bo plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the fine feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted In his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat In his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions; and his courting the reposure of solitude is an additional reason for mark ing him as a being upon whom Religion has set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her inon'te. No man can read the preceding paragraph without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love* pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion.
